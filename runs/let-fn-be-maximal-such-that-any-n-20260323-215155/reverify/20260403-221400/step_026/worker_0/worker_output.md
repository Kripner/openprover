Summary: The correct fixed-state local objects are a left cup and a right cap. With that correction, the fixed-state count is an exact product of endpoint-refined local counts, including the cases $a=1$ and/or $b=1$. Summing over states is also exact, because the state partitions the spanning convex subsets.

Assume the hypotheses of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]:
$$
P=L\sqcup R,
$$
every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$, every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, and every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

For a spanning convex subset $S\subseteq P$, write
$$
\ell=\min_x S,\qquad r=\max_x S,
$$
$$
\lambda=\max_x(S\cap L),\qquad \rho=\min_x(S\cap R).
$$
Call $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ the state of $S$.

For integers $a,b\ge 1$, let
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
$$
denote the number of spanning convex subsets $S\subseteq P$ with
$$
|S\cap L|=a,\qquad |S\cap R|=b,
$$
and state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

Define degenerate endpoint-refined local counts by
$$
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda):=
\begin{cases}
1,& a=1\text{ and }\ell=\lambda,\\
Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda),& a\ge 2\text{ and }\ell<\lambda,\\
0,&\text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
$$
and
$$
\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r):=
\begin{cases}
1,& b=1\text{ and }\rho=r,\\
Q_-(b,R;\rho,r),& b\ge 2\text{ and }\rho<r,\\
0,&\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

## Proposition

For every admissible state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ and every $a,b\ge 1$,
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r).
$$

Here the local quantities are a left cup count and a right cap count. Endpoint matching is enforced because fixing $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ forces the local endpoint pairs to be exactly $(\ell,\lambda)$ on $L$ and $(\rho,r)$ on $R$.

## Proof

Let $S$ be counted by $C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$, and list
$$
S\cap L=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_a=\lambda\},\qquad
S\cap R=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_b=r\}.
$$
By the explicit hull-chain formulas in [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]],
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_a,r,
\qquad
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b.
$$
Since $D(S)$ is a lower hull chain, its consecutive slopes are strictly increasing, so
$$
v_1,\dots,v_a
$$
is an $a$-cup in $L$ with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$ when $a\ge 2$, and when $a=1$ this says $\lambda=\ell$.
Since $U(S)$ is an upper hull chain, its consecutive slopes are strictly decreasing, so
$$
u_1,\dots,u_b
$$
is a $b$-cap in $R$ with endpoints $(\rho,r)$ when $b\ge 2$, and when $b=1$ this says $\rho=r$.

Thus
$$
\Phi(S):=(S\cap L,\;S\cap R)
$$
lands in the product counted by
$$
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r),
$$
and $\Phi$ is injective because
$$
S=(S\cap L)\sqcup(S\cap R).
$$

For surjectivity, let
$$
A=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_a=\lambda\}\subseteq L
$$
be counted by $\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)$ and let
$$
B=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_b=r\}\subseteq R
$$
be counted by $\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r)$. Set $S:=A\cup B$.

If $a\ge 2$, then $A$ is an $a$-cup, so
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_1,v_2)<\cdots<\operatorname{slope}(v_{a-1},v_a).
$$
Because $v_{a-1},v_a\in L$, every point of $R$, in particular $r$, lies strictly above the line through $v_{a-1},v_a$. Since
$$
x_{v_{a-1}}<x_{v_a}<x_r,
$$
this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_{a-1},v_a)<\operatorname{slope}(v_a,r).
$$
Hence
$$
v_1,\dots,v_a,r
$$
is an $(a+1)$-cup. For $a=1$ this chain is just $\ell,r$.

If $b\ge 2$, then $B$ is a $b$-cap, so
$$
\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2)>\cdots>\operatorname{slope}(u_{b-1},u_b).
$$
Because $u_1,u_2\in R$, every point of $L$, in particular $\ell$, lies strictly below the line through $u_1,u_2$. Since
$$
x_\ell<x_{u_1}<x_{u_2},
$$
this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)>\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2).
$$
Hence
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b
$$
is a $(b+1)$-cap. For $b=1$ this chain is just $\ell,r$.

Therefore
$$
\ell=v_1,\dots,v_a,r
$$
is a lower cup-chain and
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b=r
$$
is an upper cap-chain with the same endpoints $(\ell,r)$. The cup-chain has all interior vertices strictly below the chord $\ell r$, and the cap-chain has all interior vertices strictly above $\ell r$, so they meet only at $\ell$ and $r$. Hence the boundary of $\operatorname{conv}(S)$ is exactly the concatenation of these two chains, so $S$ is in convex position. Its state is plainly $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

Thus $\Phi$ is surjective, hence bijective, and
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r).
$$
$\square$

## State Sum

Summing over states gives an exact identity, not merely an inequality. Every spanning convex subset has a unique state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$, so the families counted by
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
$$
are disjoint and their union is exactly the family of spanning convex subsets with $|S\cap L|=a$ and $|S\cap R|=b$. Therefore the state sum is exact.

The previous draft failed because it attached the wrong local types: with a left cap and a right cup, the bridge inequalities across the split point the wrong way, so the claimed gluing map is not bijective. With the corrected left-cup/right-cap assignment, the same split inequalities give exactly the needed extensions.
