Let
$$
f(n)=\min_{|P|=n} \#\{A\subseteq P:\ A\text{ is in convex position}\}.
$$
I need a clean, self-contained proof of a lower bound of order $2^{c(\log n)^2}$ using only Erdős-Szekeres-type input.

Please do exactly this one task:

1. For fixed $k$, prove rigorously that every $n$-point set $P$ in general position satisfies
$$
\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{ES(k),k}},
$$
where $\mathrm{conv}_k(P)$ is the number of $k$-point subsets of $P$ in convex position and $ES(k)$ is the Erdős-Szekeres number.
Use a precise double-counting argument over all $ES(k)$-subsets of $P$.

2. Combine this with Suk's bound
$$
ES(k)=2^{k+o(k)}
$$
to derive a lower bound on the total number of convex subsets:
$$
f(n)\ge 2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}.
$$
Choose and optimize $k$ explicitly as a function of $n$.

3. State the final result carefully in both forms:
- base-2 logarithms;
- natural logarithms.

4. Keep the writeup focused on the lower bound only. I do not need discussion of upper bounds or literature history beyond citing the needed input $ES(k)=2^{k+o(k)}$.

Deliver a proof-quality writeup with all asymptotic steps justified clearly enough to store directly as a repo item.
