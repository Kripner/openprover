======== SYSTEM PROMPT ========

You are a senior research mathematician coordinating a proof effort.

# Your Role

You are the PLANNER. You decide WHAT to do and workers do the DOING. Never do mathematical reasoning, analysis, or problem-solving yourself - not even "just to understand the problem" or "just to get started" or to verify worker's output. If you need to understand the problem structure, explore special cases, identify useful lemmas, brainstorm proof strategies, verify or refine found proofs - spawn workers for that. Your only job is to decompose work, write clear task descriptions, and coordinate results. In particular, never write Lean code yourself - workers have specialized Lean tools (lean_verify, lean_store, lean_search) that you don't have access to. Delegate all formalization work to workers.

---

# Available Actions

- **spawn**: Send tasks to workers (they do the actual math / verification / exploration). Workers are pure reasoning - they only see the context you provide to them.
- **read_items**: Read the full content of repo items (you only see one-line summaries by default).
- **write_items**: Create, update, or delete one or more repo items.
- **read_theorem**: Re-read the original theorem statement.
- **write_whiteboard**: Update the whiteboard with new information.
- **submit_proof**: Submit the proof by referencing a repo item slug. **This terminates the session.** The proof must be complete, rigorous, and independently verified by a worker before submission.
- **literature_search**: Search the web for relevant mathematical literature. Spawns one web-enabled worker.

---

# Principles

- You are the project leader. Delegate all mathematical work to workers - including problem analysis, exploring structure, checking special cases, and brainstorming strategies. Use parallel workers when possible.
- Some problems require finding an answer before proving something about it (e.g. "find all n such that...").
- Some problems are easy - that's OK. Don't overcomplicate things.
- **Stay constructive.** Never label a problem or subproblem as "very hard", "likely intractable", etc. on the whiteboard or in task descriptions. Difficulty judgments are noise — they bias workers and waste whiteboard space. Instead, focus on *what to try next*. If an approach failed, record why and pivot; don't editorialize about how hard the problem is. Every competition problem has a solution; your job is to find it.
- **Think first, then write task descriptions.** Do ALL your reasoning, planning, and strategizing in your thinking BEFORE the OPENPROVER_ACTION block. The task `description` field must be a clean, self-contained instruction - no second-guessing, no "I think maybe...", no weighing alternatives, no stream-of-consciousness. Workers only see the description, so include all relevant context they need, but keep it crisp and direct. It's OK to be uncertain - just state it plainly (e.g. "Try X; this might not work") rather than deliberating inside the description.
- **Give workers minimal, sufficient input.** Include everything that's relevant - the specific subproblem, key definitions, known constraints, prior results they need - but nothing more. Workers are capable mathematicians who can think for themselves. Don't over-specify strategies, don't repeat obvious context, don't micromanage their approach. State *what* you need answered, provide the context they can't derive on their own, and let them work.
- Balance exploration and direct proof attempts.
- Store failed attempts in the repo - they prevent repeating mistakes.
- **One focused task per worker.** Each worker should tackle ONE specific clearly defined question or subproblem. When you need to explore several cases or approaches (e.g. case analysis, checking multiple candidate values, trying alternative proof strategies, verifying independent parts of a proof), assign exactly one case/approach per worker - never give a single worker multiple semi-independent cases. If you have more cases than available workers, prioritize the most promising or informative ones first, and note the remaining cases on the whiteboard (or as repo items if they're detailed) to explore in later steps. Exception: trivial cases that need no real work can be grouped together or handled inline.
- Workers may return partial results (e.g. useful lemmas but incomplete proof). That's fine - decide whether to spawn a follow-up worker to continue from their progress, or pivot to a different approach.
- **Keep worker tasks small.** Don't overload a single worker with too much work in one spawn. It's better to get results back quickly and iterate than to wait for a worker doing five things at once. Give each worker a tightly scoped task; you can always spawn follow-ups based on what comes back.
- **Don't stop at partial results.** If the problem has multiple levels of difficulty (e.g. "find exact x, or at least an approximation", "prove P, or at least show Q"), or if you solve a relaxation/special case before the full problem - save that result to the repo via write_items, reference it from the whiteboard with [[slug]], and keep working toward the full solution. A partial result is progress, not the finish line.
- Don't get stuck. If the first proof avenue does not work, try others.
- **Keep the whiteboard up-to-date.** Your VERY NEXT action after receiving worker results or completing any significant step MUST be write_whiteboard. Do not proceed to spawn, write_items, or submit_proof without first updating the whiteboard. The whiteboard is your primary memory between steps - if it's stale, you'll repeat work or forget what you've learned. Record: current proof plan, failed attempts (brief, but say *why* they failed), ideas to return to later (backlog), key results obtained. **Include substance, not just status.** Don't write 'Proof found' - write the 1-2 sentence proof idea. Don't write 'Worker failed' - write what was tried and why it didn't work. **The whiteboard must make sense standalone.** Every term, case, or label you mention must be defined or explained on the whiteboard itself (even if briefly) or have a [[ref]] to a repo item where the reader can find the details. Don't write 'Missing cases 2-4' if the cases aren't listed anywhere the reader can see. Long content belongs in the repo (use write_items) - their one-line summaries appear automatically alongside the whiteboard, so the whiteboard can just reference repo items with [[item-slug]] where applicable.
- Use literature_search sparingly (2-3 times max). Store results in the repo immediately.
- **Never spawn workers for literature search or recall.** Workers have no web access and no knowledge of specific theorems or papers - they will hallucinate citations. To find existing results, use the `literature_search` action (a planner-level action that spawns a web-enabled worker). Only spawn regular workers for doing original mathematical reasoning.
- Write proofs as repo items first (via write_items). This lets you refine, verify, and iterate on the proof before submitting. When ready, use submit_proof with the item's slug.
- Have the proof independently verified by a worker before calling submit_proof.

---

# Whiteboard Style

Terse, dense, like shorthand on a real whiteboard:
- Sections: Goal, Plan (current proof strategy), Failed (past attempts - what & why), Backlog (ideas to revisit, with [[refs]] if applicable), Status, Open Questions
- Use LaTeX (will be displayed via MathJax): $inline$ and $$display$$
- Abbreviations and arrows freely
"WLOG assume $p,q$ coprime" not "Without loss of generality..."
- Keep it concise - long results belong in repo items, not on the whiteboard.
- But DO include key insights: proof ideas (1-2 sentences), why approaches failed, important observations. Status without substance is useless.

---

# Repo Items

Items in the repo are [[slug]]-referenced files. Markdown items have format:
```
Summary: One sentence.

<full content>
```

Store: proven lemmas, failed attempts (brief), key observations, literature findings.
Each item should be self-contained and atomic - one logical thing per item.
Don't store: trivial facts, work-in-progress that belongs on the whiteboard.

---

## submit_proof

submit_proof references a repo item slug - write the proof as a repo item first, then submit when finalized. NEVER submit unless the proof has been VERIFIED by an independent worker. submit_proof **terminates the session** - there is no going back.

---

# Output Format

Think step by step, then output one or more TOML action blocks. Each block is wrapped in <OPENPROVER_ACTION> ... </OPENPROVER_ACTION> tags and contains EXACTLY ONE action.

**Rules:**
- Each block MUST have `action` and `summary` fields. Exception: `spawn` - the summary goes on each `[[tasks]]` entry instead.
- At most ONE `spawn` block per step (spawning is expensive).
- Low-impact actions (write_whiteboard, read_items, read_theorem, write_items) can be combined freely with each other and with spawn.
- Typical pattern: write_whiteboard + spawn, or write_whiteboard + write_items + spawn.

Example with two blocks:

<OPENPROVER_ACTION>
action = "write_whiteboard"
summary = "Update plan after worker results"
whiteboard = """
...
"""
</OPENPROVER_ACTION>

<OPENPROVER_ACTION>
action = "spawn"

[[tasks]]
summary = "Prove upper bound via angular order statistics"
description = """
Full task instructions here...
"""
</OPENPROVER_ACTION>

Valid actions: submit_proof, submit_lean_proof, give_up, read_items, write_items, spawn, literature_search, read_theorem, write_whiteboard

## Action-specific TOML fields

**submit_proof**: `proof_slug = "slug-of-proof-item"`
**read_items**: `read = ["slug-1", "slug-2"]`
**write_items**: one or more `[[items]]` sections:
<OPENPROVER_ACTION>
action = "write_items"

[[items]]
slug = "item-slug"
content = """
Summary: One sentence.

Full content here.
"""

[[items]]
slug = "another-item"
# omit content to delete
</OPENPROVER_ACTION>

Slugs can contain `/` for subdirectories, e.g. `"attempts/induction-v1"`, `"lemmas/helper"`.

**spawn**: one or more `[[tasks]]` sections, each with `summary = "..."` (clear, human-readable label explaining the worker's purpose - shown in the UI) and `description = """..."""` (full task)
**write_whiteboard**: `whiteboard = """..."""` (complete replacement of current whiteboard)
**literature_search**: `search_query = "..."` and `search_context = """..."""`

## Goal

Produce a proof of this theorem:

### Theorem
Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three on a line, determine at least $f(n)$ different convex subsets. Estimate $f(n)$ - in particular, does there exist a constant $c$ such that

$$\lim \frac{\log f(n)}{(\log n)^2}=c?$$

# What we have

- Theorem statement: already present
- Proof: missing

# Repository

- [[attempts/alternative-construction-balanced-ternary-split]]: For the balanced ternary separated recursion, the total convex-subset count decomposes exactly into one-child, two-child, and endpoint-refined three-child terms, but exact recursive propagation of the new bridge-state quantities $U_m,D_m$ is still unresolved.
- [[attempts/alternative-construction-fibonacci-split]]: Replacing the balanced split by the non-self-similar separated recursion $F_m=F_{m-1}\sqcup F_{m-2}$ gives exact recurrences different from the balanced family, but one explicit top-split term already forces
- [[attempts/balanced-ternary-bridge-conjugation-expansion]]: Expanding the ternary bridge quantities $U_m,D_m$ child-by-child gives exact recursive formulas in terms of half-plane counts indexed by conjugated affine map pairs, but it remains unresolved whether those pairs collapse to the currently tracked state in a fixed balanced ternary template.
- [[attempts/endpoint-matched-recursive-family-worst-case-gap]]: Endpoint matching in the recursive family leads to natural one-sided endpoint quantities and exact recurrences, but the first aggregate argument only used a worst-case bound over endpoint pairs and therefore did not prove that endpoint matching gives no improvement.
- [[attempts/information-loss-note-crossing-convention-mismatch]]: The latest information-loss patch failed because the stored fixed-state and crossing notes appear to use incompatible cup/cap conventions, so the exact crossing passage could not be justified self-containedly from the cited items.
- [[attempts/one-split-fixed-state-product-draft-flaw]]: The first fixed-state endpoint-refined recurrence draft failed because its main slope-chain argument had the inequalities reversed, so the claimed product formula was not proved.
- [[attempts/one-split-structure-draft]]: Draft one-split structural lemma says a convex subset spanning the recursive split decomposes as a left cap plus right cup under explicit left-right and high-above hypotheses, but the proof still needs two minor rigor fixes.
- [[bounds/lower-bound-averaging]]: Verified Erdős-Szekeres averaging proof that $f(n)\ge 2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}$.
- [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]]: Verified upper bound via a recursively separated family showing $f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}$.
- [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]]: Under the one-split hypotheses, every spanning cup has exactly one right point and every spanning cap exactly one left point, yielding exact endpoint-refined crossing identities.
- [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]]: For a fixed state in a one-split configuration, spanning convex subsets are counted exactly by a product of a left endpoint-refined cup count and a right endpoint-refined cap count; summing over states is also exact.
- [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]: Under left-right separation plus the two high-above secant conditions, any convex subset meeting both sides of a split decomposes uniquely as a left cup and a right cap, with endpoint state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.
- [[lemmas/ternary-one-split-structure]]: In a clean left-middle-right ternary split with the vertical-dual one-split orientation, every convex subset meeting more than one block is classified exactly as follows: for any two-block span, the earlier block contributes a cap and the later block contributes a cup; for a three-block span, the left block is a cap, the right block is a cup, and the middle block contributes at most one upper bridge point and at most one lower bridge point, determined by the endpoint-dependent bridge lines $\lambda r$ and $\ell\rho$. All formulas below are exact identities.
- [[status/balanced-ternary-concrete-bridge-obstruction]]: For the explicit balanced ternary template
- [[status/endpoint-matched-recursive-family]]: After summing the exact fixed-endpoint identity over the actual endpoint pairs of a given first-separation scale, the endpoint-matched count factorizes exactly as
- [[status/fixed-lag-separated-recursions-obstruction]]: For the fixed-lag separated recursion
- [[status/literature-total-convex-subsets]]: Literature search found no source improving the current total-count bracket or resolving existence of the $(\log n)^2$-scale limit for the minimum number of convex-position subsets.
- [[status/one-split-convention-audit]]: The stored fixed-state note and the stored crossing note use opposite local cup/cap assignments. Using the displayed hull-chain formulas from [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]], the canonical assignment is left cup and right cap. Hence the fixed-state note is consistent, while the crossing note is mathematically wrong as written. The structure note also has its concluding cup/cap labels reversed and should be corrected at the same time.
- [[status/recursive-family-information-loss]]: With the repaired one-split convention, the spanning recurrence is exactly a left-cup/right-cap factorization, and the crossing cup/cap formulas are exact endpoint-refined identities. The first place [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]] truly loses the matched outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$ is the chain-pair inequality

# Recent History

## Step 6: read_theorem - Re-read the exact theorem statement

### Planner

Looking at the worker's results, the upper bound computation is correct but there's a crucial subtlety: the cups-caps construction controls cups/caps, not arbitrary convex subsets. I need to re-read the exact theorem statement and then think more carefully about which construction to use and what the correct constant is.

<OPENPROVER_ACTION>
action = "read_theorem"
summary = "Re-read the exact theorem statement"
</OPENPROVER_ACTION>

### Result

## THEOREM.md

Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three on a line, determine at least $f(n)$ different convex subsets. Estimate $f(n)$ - in particular, does there exist a constant $c$ such that

$$\lim \frac{\log f(n)}{(\log n)^2}=c?$$


## Step 7: literature_search - Search for results on counting convex subsets of point sets

### Planner

Looking at the worker's result and the key subtlety it identified (cups-caps construction ≠ convex position construction), I need to clarify the problem structure. Let me re-read the theorem, update my understanding, and search the literature.

<OPENPROVER_ACTION>
action = "write_whiteboard"
summary = "Update whiteboard with refined understanding after worker result"
whiteboard = """
## Goal
$f(n)$ = min over $n$-point sets in general position of #subsets in convex position. Show $\lim \frac{\log f(n)}{(\log n)^2} = c$ and find $c$.

## Key Facts (from literature)
- **ES cups-caps**: $\binom{r+s-4}{r-2}+1$ points always contain $r$-cup or $s$-cap. Extremal config: $n = \binom{2k-2}{k-1}$ pts, no convex $(k+1)$-gon, so $k \approx \frac{1}{2}\log_2 n$.
- **Suk 2016**: $ES(k) = 2^{k+o(k)}$ (nearly optimal).
- **Upper bound**: ES construction ⇒ max convex subset size $k \approx \frac{1}{2}\log_2 n$, total convex subsets $\leq \sum_{j\leq k}\binom{n}{j} \approx 2^{\frac{1}{2}(\log_2 n)^2(1+o(1))}$.
- **Lower bound**: Only known $f(n) \geq 2^{\Omega(\log n)}$ from single large convex subset. Need $2^{c(\log n)^2}$.

## Plan
1. [NEXT] Worker: Compute upper bound precisely from ES extremal construction
2. [THEN] Worker: Develop lower bound — every $n$-pt set has $\geq 2^{c(\log n)^2}$ convex subsets
3. Determine $c$

## Conjectured answer
$c = 1/2$ (if $\log = \log_2$) or $c = 1/(2\ln 2)$ (if $\log = \ln$)

## Notes
- In ES extremal construction: $n = \binom{2k-2}{k-1}$, no $(k+1)$-convex subset
- $\log_2 n \approx 2k$, so $k \approx \frac{1}{2}\log_2 n$
- #convex subsets $\leq \sum_{j=0}^{k}\binom{n}{j}$, dominated by $\binom{n}{k} \leq (en/k)^k$
- $\log_2 \binom{n}{k} \approx k \cdot \log_2 n \approx \frac{1}{2}(\log_2 n)^2$

"""
</OPENPROVER_ACTION>

### Result

**Main Takeaway**

I did not find a paper that explicitly studies  
`f(n) = min_P #{A ⊆ P : A in convex position}`  
or the limit of `log f(n)/(\log n)^2`. But the literature already gives the right order of growth:

`log f(n) = Θ((log n)^2)`.

The open part seems to be the constant in front, not the `(\log n)^2` scale.

**What is known**

- For each fixed `k`, let `conv_k(n)` be the minimum number of convex `k`-subsets in an `n`-point set in general position. Then `conv_4(n)=\overline{cr}(n)=Θ(n^4)`, and for every fixed `k≥5`, `conv_k(n)=Θ(n^k)`. A good summary source is Aichholzer et al., *On k-gons and k-holes in point sets*:
  https://upcommons.upc.edu/entities/publication/03ad3b9a-dd7d-431f-94c0-281d7948afe5

- Goaoc–Hubard–de Joannis de Verclos–Sereni–Volec, *Limits of Order Types*, study the minimum densities  
  `c_k = lim conv_k(n)/binom(n,k)`  
  and prove by flag algebras that `c_5 ≥ 0.0608516` and `c_6 ≥ 0.0018311`; they also discuss recursive Erdős-Szekeres/Horton-type limits where convex-`k` densities decay like `2^{-Θ(k^2)}`:
  https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.SOCG.2015.300

- Most relevant for your question: by double counting, for every `k`,
  `conv_k(n) ≥ binom(n,k) / binom(ES(k),k)`,
  where `ES(k)` is the Erdős-Szekeres number.
  This is an inference from the Erdős-Szekeres theorem.

- Combining that with Suk’s bound `ES(k)=2^{k+o(k)}` gives
  `conv_k(n) ≥ 2^{k log_2 n - k^2 - o(k^2)}`
  for suitable `k`, hence
  `log_2 f(n) ≥ (1/4 - o(1)) (log_2 n)^2`.
  Source for the modern `ES(k)` bound:
  https://doi.org/10.1090/jams/869

- The upper-bound direction is classical from Erdős-Szekeres extremal constructions: there are `n`-point sets with no convex subset larger than `(1+o(1)) log_2 n`, so
  `f(n) ≤ Σ_{j≤(1+o(1))log_2 n} binom(n,j) = 2^{(1+o(1)) (log_2 n)^2}`.
  So `Θ((log n)^2)` is already forced on both sides.

- Goaoc et al. go further: their recursive ES/Horton-type limit `ℓ_H` has convex-`k` density `≤ 2^{-Θ(k^2)}` (more precisely, their cup/cap argument gives about `2^{-k^2/8+O(k log k)}` for `k` points in convex position). This is the closest thing I found to literature directly supporting the “correct constant” program.

**Useful techniques / papers**

- Flag algebras and order-type limits for fixed-`k` densities:
  https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.SOCG.2015.300

- Continuous-motion / alternating-sum identities for counts `X_{k,ℓ}` of convex `k`-gons with `ℓ` interior points:
  https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-022-00395-8

- Earlier identities for empty convex polygons:
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcta.2005.03.007

- Fixed-`k` extremal counting summary:
  https://upcommons.upc.edu/entities/publication/03ad3b9a-dd7d-431f-94c0-281d7948afe5

**Bottom line**

- I found no paper explicitly on the limit  
  `lim log f(n)/(\log n)^2`.
- But existing literature already implies
  `f(n)=2^{Θ((\log n)^2)}`.
- The most relevant existing machinery for the constant appears to be:
  Erdős-Szekeres averaging for lower bounds, and recursive ES/Horton-type constructions plus order-type limits/flag algebras for upper bounds and density heuristics.

## Step 8: spawn - Determine the correct constant c for log f(n)/(log n)^2

### Planner

Looking at the current state, I have a lower bound of $c \geq 1/4$ (from averaging with Suk's bound) and a trivial upper bound of $c \leq 1$. I need to close this gap. The key is understanding how many convex subsets the ES constructions actually have. Let me spawn a focused worker on the most critical question.

<OPENPROVER_ACTION>
action = "write_whiteboard"
summary = "Update whiteboard with detailed analysis of bounds and key open questions"
whiteboard = """
## Goal
$f(n)$ = min over $n$-point sets in general position of #convex subsets. Does $\lim \frac{\log f(n)}{(\log n)^2} = c$ exist? Find $c$.

## Established Bounds
- **Lower bound**: $c \geq 1/4$ (base 2). Proof: averaging argument with $ES(k)=2^{k+o(k)}$ (Suk). For each $j$, #convex $j$-subsets $c_j \geq \binom{n}{j}/\binom{ES(j)}{j}$. Key: $\log_2(c_j) \geq j\log_2 n - j^2 + o(j^2)$. Optimized at $j=\frac{1}{2}\log_2 n$, giving $(\log_2 n)^2/4$. See [[upper-bound-computation]].
- **Upper bound**: $c \leq 1$. Any ES construction with max convex size $K \sim \log_2 n$ gives $F \leq \sum_{j \leq K}\binom{n}{j} = 2^{(1+o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}$.

## Key Open Question
Gap between $1/4$ and $1$. Need to determine actual # convex subsets in ES constructions.

## Two ES Constructions
1. **Cups-caps ES**: $n=\binom{2k-2}{k-1}$, no $(k+1)$-cup/cap, max convex $\leq 2k-2 \approx \log_2 n$
2. **Convex-position ES**: $n = 2^{k-2}$, no convex $(k+1)$-gon, max convex $\leq k \approx \log_2 n$

Both give trivial upper bound $c \leq 1$. Need to count actual convex subsets.

## Analysis of Convex-Position ES Construction
Recursive: $P_k = A \cup B$, $|A|=|B|=2^{k-3}$, each copy of $P_{k-1}$.
$F(k) = 2F(k-1) + M(k) - 1$. Need to determine $M(k)$ (mixed convex subsets).

## Conjectured Answer
Likely $c = 1/4$ (base 2) = $1/(4\ln 2)$ (base $e$), matching the averaging lower bound.

## Next Step
Spawn worker to analyze the ES construction and determine $F(k)$ asymptotics, OR find improved lower bound argument exceeding $1/4$.

**Problem**: Let $f(n)$ = minimum number of convex-position subsets over all $n$-point sets in general position in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We want to determine $c = \lim \frac{\log_2 f(n)}{(\log_2 n)^2}$ (if it exists).

**Known bounds**:
- Lower bound: $c \geq 1/4$. Proof: By Suk's bound $ES(k) = 2^{k+o(k)}$, every $n$-point set has $\geq \binom{n}{j}/\binom{ES(j)}{j}$ convex $j$-subsets. With $\log_2 c_j \geq j\log_2 n - j^2 + o(j^2)$, optimized at $j = \frac{1}{2}\log_2 n$, giving $\frac{1}{4}(\log_2 n)^2$.

- Upper bound: $c \leq 1$. The Erdős-Szekeres lower-bound construction gives $n$-point sets with max convex subset size $K \approx \log_2 n$, so $f(n) \leq \sum_{j=0}^K \binom{n}{j} = 2^{(1+o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}$.

**Your task**: Determine the correct value of $c$. Specifically:

1. **Can the lower bound be improved beyond 1/4?** Consider whether there are counting arguments beyond the simple averaging that give more convex subsets. For instance:
   - Can we find many DISJOINT convex subsets whose unions are also convex?
   - Does the downward-closed structure of convex subsets help (every subset of a convex set is convex)?
   - Can the cups-caps partition structure give better bounds?

2. **Can the upper bound be reduced below 1?** Analyze the Erdős-Szekeres recursive construction $P_k$ with $|P_k| = 2^{k-2}$ and no convex $(k+1)$-gon. This is built as $P_k = A \cup B$ where $A, B$ are copies of $P_{k-1}$. Let $F(k) = |\mathcal{C}(P_k)|$. Then $F(k) = 2F(k-1) + M(k) - 1$ where $M(k)$ counts mixed convex subsets. How large is $M(k)$? 
   - If $M(k) \leq F(k-1)^{O(1)}$, then $\log F(k) = O(k)$, way below $k^2$.
   - If $M(k) \approx 2^{ck^2}$, determine $c$.
   
3. **Key question about the ES construction**: In the ES lower-bound construction with $n = 2^{k-2}$ points and no $(k+1)$-gon, what is the number of convex $j$-subsets for $j \approx k/2$? Is it close to $\binom{n}{j}/\binom{ES(j)}{j} \approx 2^{k^2/4}$, or is it close to $\binom{n}{j} \approx 2^{k^2/2}$?

4. Based on your analysis, state the value of $c$ (or tight bounds on it) and give a proof sketch for both the upper and lower bounds.

**Important**: A "convex subset" means a subset of the point set that is in convex position (all points are vertices of their convex hull). The empty set, singletons, pairs, and triples (in general position) are always convex. The set $\mathcal{C}(P)$ of convex subsets is downward-closed: every subset of a convex set is convex.

$$2^{(\frac14-o(1))L^2} \le f(n) \le 2^{L^2+O(L)}.$$
Need either a sharper upper bound, a sharper lower bound, or evidence the constant is unresolved with current methods.

## Plan
1. Read the exact verified lower/upper bound items and the obstruction notes.
2. Identify the first genuinely lossy step in the recursive-family upper bound.
3. Next spawn: one worker on that single obstruction (not on the whole constant problem at once).

## Failed
- Broad “determine $c$” worker task is too diffuse.
- Literature [[status/literature-total-convex-subsets]] gives $\Theta((\log n)^2)$ but no constant.

## Backlog
- If the recursive-family obstruction looks structural, ask a worker for a better lower-bound mechanism beyond averaging.
- If endpoint-matching really improves the recurrence, push that route first.

## Status
- Lower bound is in [[bounds/lower-bound-averaging]].
- Current recursive-family upper bound is in [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].
- Endpoint-matched and information-loss notes suggest the bottleneck is already isolated, but I need the exact statements before assigning the next worker.

## Open Questions
- What is the first inequality where the upper-bound proof loses the matched outer endpoints?
- Does endpoint-matching change the exponent below $1$?
- Is there already enough in the repo to formulate a targeted worker task around that loss step?
