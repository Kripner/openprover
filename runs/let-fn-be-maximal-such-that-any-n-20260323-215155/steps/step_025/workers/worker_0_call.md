# Task

Use [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]], [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]], and [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].

Work on exactly one task: produce the clean endpoint-refined recurrence note for spanning convex subsets across one recursive split.

Context:
- For the recursive family, $P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m$ with $L_m,R_m$ affine copies of $P_{m-1}$ in the one-split position covered by [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]].
- We now have the verified stronger crossing fact in [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]]: every spanning cup has exactly one point in the left half and every spanning cap exactly one point in the right half, with exact endpoint-refined crossing identities.
- The earlier draft already suggested endpoint-refined quantities counting cups, caps, and spanning convex subsets with fixed state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$, but it was unclear which statements are exact equalities and which are only upper bounds.

Deliverable:
Produce a short polished note suitable to store directly as a repo item, with:
1. minimal precise definitions of the endpoint-refined quantities you actually need;
2. the rigorous one-split recurrences/identities/inequalities that follow for those quantities;
3. explicit use of the exact crossing identities where they are now justified;
4. a clear statement of whether the spanning-convex count with fixed state is an exact product or only an inequality under the stored hypotheses, with proof or explanation;
5. one brief sentence explaining how endpoint matching is enforced.

Requirements:
- Keep it self-contained relative to the two stored lemmas above.
- Do not do asymptotic analysis or solve the recurrence.
- Do not use literature.
- Do not write Lean.
- If a statement is only an upper bound, say so plainly; if an exact identity is available, prove it.
- Aim for a note ready to store under a slug such as `lemmas/one-split-endpoint-refined-recurrence`.

## [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]

Summary: Under left-right separation plus the two high-above secant conditions, any convex subset meeting both sides of a split decomposes uniquely as a left cap and a right cup, with endpoint state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

Let
$$
P=L\sqcup R
$$
be a finite planar point set. After a sufficiently small generic rotation, assume all points of $P$ have distinct $x$-coordinates, and that:

1. every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$;
2. every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$;
3. every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

These are the only geometric properties of the recursive split used below.

For a subset $S\subset P$ in convex position, write $U(S)$ and $D(S)$ for the upper and lower hull chains of $S$, both listed from left to right.

**Lemma.** Let $S\subset P$ be in convex position and assume
$$
S\cap L\neq\varnothing,\qquad S\cap R\neq\varnothing.
$$
Let
$$
\ell=\text{leftmost point of }S,\qquad r=\text{rightmost point of }S,
$$
and let
$$
\lambda=\text{rightmost point of }(S\cap L),\qquad
\rho=\text{leftmost point of }(S\cap R).
$$
Then:

1. $\ell\in L$ and $r\in R$.
2. $U(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $L$, namely $\ell$.
3. $D(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $R$, namely $r$.

Consequently, if the points of $S\cap R$ are listed in increasing $x$-order as
$$
\rho=u_1,\dots,u_t=r,
$$
then
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t.
$$
Likewise, if the points of $S\cap L$ are listed in increasing $x$-order as
$$
\ell=v_1,\dots,v_s=\lambda,
$$
then
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r.
$$
Equivalently, the points of $S\cap R$ are exactly the $R$-vertices on $U(S)$, and the points of $S\cap L$ are exactly the $L$-vertices on $D(S)$. Hence $S\cap R$ forms a cup with endpoints $(\rho,r)$, and $S\cap L$ forms a cap with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$.

In particular,
$$
S=(\text{cap in }L\text{ with endpoints }(\ell,\lambda))
\sqcup
(\text{cup in }R\text{ with endpoints }(\rho,r)),
$$
with the degenerate cases $\ell=\lambda$ and $\rho=r$ allowed.

**Proof.** By (1), every point of $L$ has smaller $x$-coordinate than every point of $R$. Since $S$ meets both halves, its leftmost point lies in $L$ and its rightmost point lies in $R$, so $\ell\in L$ and $r\in R$.

Because all $x$-coordinates are distinct, each hull chain $U(S)$ and $D(S)$ is strictly monotone in $x$. Hence on either chain every vertex from $L$ appears before every vertex from $R$.

Suppose $U(S)$ contains at least two vertices from $L$. Let $p,q$ be the last two such vertices along $U(S)$ from left to right. They are consecutive on $U(S)$: any vertex between them on that chain would have $x$-coordinate between those of $p$ and $q$, hence by the left-right separation would also lie in $L$, contradicting the choice of $p,q$ as the last two $L$-vertices. Since $pq$ is an edge of the upper hull of $S$, every point of $S$ lies on or below the line through $p,q$. But $p,q\in L$, so by (2) every point of $R$, hence every point of $S\cap R$, lies strictly above that line. This contradicts $S\cap R\neq\varnothing$. Therefore $U(S)$ contains at most one vertex from $L$, and since $\ell\in U(S)\cap L$, it contains exactly one such vertex, namely $\ell$.

The lower-hull statement is symmetric. If $D(S)$ contained at least two vertices from $R$, let $p,q$ be the first two such vertices along $D(S)$ from left to right. Again they are consecutive on $D(S)$, because any intermediate vertex would also lie in $R$. Since $pq$ is an edge of the lower hull, every point of $S$ lies on or above the line through $p,q$. But $p,q\in R$, so by (3) every point of $L$, hence every point of $S\cap L$, lies strictly below that line, contradiction. Thus $D(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $R$, namely $r$.

Now use the endpoint-aware hull decomposition: every non-endpoint vertex of a set in convex position lies on exactly one of the two chains $U(S),D(S)$, while the common endpoints $\ell,r$ lie on both. Since the only $R$-vertex on $D(S)$ is the endpoint $r$, every point of $S\cap R\setminus\{r\}$ lies on $U(S)$. Hence all points of $S\cap R$ occur on $U(S)$, and by $x$-monotonicity they appear there exactly in increasing $x$-order, from $\rho$ to $r$. This gives
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t.
$$
Similarly, since the only $L$-vertex on $U(S)$ is the endpoint $\ell$, every point of $S\cap L\setminus\{\ell\}$ lies on $D(S)$, so the points of $S\cap L$ appear on $D(S)$ exactly in increasing $x$-order from $\ell$ to $\lambda$, giving
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r.
$$
The cap-cup decomposition follows immediately. $\square$

For a later recurrence, the natural endpoint/state data is
$$
(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r),
$$
equivalently a left-cap state indexed by $(\ell,\lambda)$ together with a right-cup state indexed by $(\rho,r)$. The outer entries $\ell$ and $r$ are the global leftmost and rightmost points of the spanning convex set, while $\lambda$ and $\rho$ record the terminal vertices of the left and right local chains at the split. Thus this state keeps exactly the global-endpoint information lost by aggregate cup/cap totals such as $Q_+$ and $Q_-$.


## [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]]

Summary: Under the one-split hypotheses, every spanning cup has exactly one left point and every spanning cap exactly one right point, yielding exact endpoint-refined crossing identities.

Assume the hypotheses of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]: namely
$$
P=L\sqcup R,
$$
every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$, every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, and every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

For $t\ge 2$ and points $a,b$ of a planar point set $X$, write $Q_+(t,X;a,b)$ for the number of $t$-cups in $X$ whose left and right endpoints are $a,b$, and $Q_-(t,X;a,b)$ for the number of $t$-caps in $X$ whose left and right endpoints are $a,b$. Equivalently, in left-to-right order, the consecutive slopes of a cup are strictly increasing and those of a cap are strictly decreasing.

For $\ell\in L$, $r\in R$, and $t\ge 2$, write $Q_+^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)$ for the number of spanning $(t+1)$-cups $S\subseteq P$ with global endpoints $(\ell,r)$. Define $Q_-^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)$ analogously for spanning caps.

**Proposition.**
Under the one-split hypotheses, the following hold.

1. If $S\subseteq P$ is a spanning cup with global endpoints $(\ell,r)$, then
$$
S\cap L=\{\ell\}.
$$
So every spanning cup has exactly one point in the left half, namely its global left endpoint.

2. If $S\subseteq P$ is a spanning cap with global endpoints $(\ell,r)$, then
$$
S\cap R=\{r\}.
$$
So every spanning cap has exactly one point in the right half, namely its global right endpoint.

3. Consequently, for every $\ell\in L$, $r\in R$, and $t\ge 2$,
$$
Q_+^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\rho\in R,\ \rho<r} Q_+(t,R;\rho,r),
$$
and
$$
Q_-^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\lambda\in L,\ \ell<\lambda} Q_-(t,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$

Here $\rho<r$ and $\ell<\lambda$ refer to the left-to-right $x$-order.

**Proof.**
Let $S\subseteq P$ be spanning, and use the notation of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]:
$$
\ell=\min_x S,\qquad r=\max_x S,
$$
$$
\lambda=\max_x(S\cap L),\qquad \rho=\min_x(S\cap R).
$$
That lemma shows that $S\cap L$ is a cap with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$, $S\cap R$ is a cup with endpoints $(\rho,r)$, and if
$$
S\cap L=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_s=\lambda\},
$$
then
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r,
$$
while if
$$
S\cap R=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_t=r\},
$$
then
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t.
$$

Now suppose that $S$ is itself a cup. Then its lower hull has only the two global endpoints $\ell,r$. Comparing with
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r
$$
forces $s=1$, hence $\lambda=\ell$ and
$$
S\cap L=\{\ell\}.
$$
This proves (1).

The proof of (2) is dual. If $S$ is a spanning cap, then its upper hull has only the two global endpoints $\ell,r$. Comparing with
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t
$$
forces $t=1$, hence $\rho=r$ and
$$
S\cap R=\{r\}.
$$

For the counting identities, fix $\ell\in L$, $r\in R$, and $t\ge 2$.

For cups, define
$$
\Phi(S)=S\cap R.
$$
By (1), this gives a map from spanning $(t+1)$-cups with endpoints $(\ell,r)$ into the disjoint union over $\rho\in R$ with $\rho<r$ of the sets of $t$-cups in $R$ with endpoints $(\rho,r)$. It is injective because
$$
S=\{\ell\}\sqcup \Phi(S).
$$

To prove surjectivity, let
$$
T=\{u_1=\rho<u_2<\cdots<u_t=r\}\subseteq R
$$
be a $t$-cup, and set
$$
S:=\{\ell\}\cup T.
$$
Since $T$ is a cup,
$$
\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2)<\operatorname{slope}(u_2,u_3)<\cdots<\operatorname{slope}(u_{t-1},u_t).
$$
Also, $u_1,u_2\in R$, so the line through $u_1,u_2$ lies strictly above every point of $L$, in particular above $\ell$. Because $x_\ell<x_{u_1}<x_{u_2}$, this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)<\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2).
$$
Hence
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)
<
\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2)
<
\cdots
<
\operatorname{slope}(u_{t-1},u_t),
$$
so
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t
$$
is a $(t+1)$-cup with endpoints $(\ell,r)$. This includes the case $t=2$: one only uses
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)<\operatorname{slope}(u_1,r),
$$
so no separate interior-point argument is needed.

Therefore $\Phi$ is bijective, and taking cardinalities gives
$$
Q_+^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\rho\in R,\ \rho<r} Q_+(t,R;\rho,r).
$$

The cap identity is dual. Let
$$
T=\{v_1=\ell<v_2<\cdots<v_t=\lambda\}\subseteq L
$$
be a $t$-cap, and set
$$
S:=T\cup\{r\}.
$$
Since $T$ is a cap,
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_1,v_2)>\operatorname{slope}(v_2,v_3)>\cdots>\operatorname{slope}(v_{t-1},v_t).
$$
Also, $v_{t-1},v_t\in L$, so the line through $v_{t-1},v_t$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, in particular below $r$. Because $x_{v_{t-1}}<x_{v_t}<x_r$, this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_{t-1},v_t)>\operatorname{slope}(v_t,r).
$$
Hence
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_1,v_2)>
\cdots>
\operatorname{slope}(v_{t-1},v_t)>
\operatorname{slope}(v_t,r),
$$
so
$$
v_1,\dots,v_t,r
$$
is a $(t+1)$-cap with endpoints $(\ell,r)$. Thus
$$
Q_-^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\lambda\in L,\ \ell<\lambda} Q_-(t,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$

Endpoint matching is enforced because the global outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$ are fixed, while the split lemma recovers uniquely the first right-side vertex $\rho$ for cups and the last left-side vertex $\lambda$ for caps. $\square$

## [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]]

Summary: Verified upper bound via a recursively separated family showing $f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}$.

Let $P_1$ be a two-point set, and for $m\ge 2$ let
$$
P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m
$$
where $L_m$ and $R_m$ are affine copies of $P_{m-1}$ in the standard recursively separated position. Thus
$$
|P_m|=2^m \qquad (m\ge 1).
$$

For each fixed $m$, we may first apply a sufficiently small generic rotation to $P_m$ so that all points of $P_m$ have distinct $x$-coordinates. This does not change the order type, hence does not change which subsets are in convex position. After this normalization, for $r\ge 2$ let $Q_+(r,P_m)$ and $Q_-(r,P_m)$ denote respectively the numbers of $r$-cups and $r$-caps in $P_m$. For $k\ge 1$, let $C_k(P_m)$ be the number of $k$-point subsets of $P_m$ in convex position, and set
$$
g(P_m):=\sum_{k=1}^{2^m} C_k(P_m).
$$

We first record the cup/cap bound.

**Lemma.** For each $r\ge 2$ there is a constant $d_r>0$ such that
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le d_r\,2^{rm}\qquad\text{for all }m\ge 1.
$$

**Proof.** The base case $r=2$ is explicit:
$$
Q_+(2,P_m)=Q_-(2,P_m)=\binom{2^m}{2}\le 2^{2m},
$$
so we may take $d_2=1$.

Now fix $r\ge 3$ and assume $d_{r-1}$ has already been chosen. For $m=1$ we have $Q_\pm(r,P_1)=0$, since $|P_1|=2<r$. For $m\ge 2$, every $r$-cup in $P_m$ is either contained entirely in $L_m$ or entirely in $R_m$, or else consists of one point from one side together with an $(r-1)$-cup from the other side; the same dichotomy holds for $r$-caps. Hence
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le 2\,Q_\pm(r,P_{m-1})+2^{m-1}Q_\pm(r-1,P_{m-1}).
$$
Choose $d_r$ so that
$$
(2^r-2)d_r\ge d_{r-1}.
$$
Then, using the inductive bounds in $m$ and in $r$,
\[
\begin{aligned}
Q_\pm(r,P_m)
&\le 2d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}+2^{m-1}d_{r-1}\,2^{(r-1)(m-1)} \\
&= \bigl(2d_r+d_{r-1}\bigr)2^{r(m-1)}
 \le 2^r d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}
 = d_r\,2^{rm}.
\end{aligned}
\]
This proves the claim. $\square$

Now let $k\ge 2$. Every convex $k$-subset $S\subseteq P_m$ has a unique leftmost point and a unique rightmost point. Along the upper hull from left to right one obtains an $a$-cup for some $2\le a\le k$, and along the lower hull one obtains a $(k+2-a)$-cap. Forgetting the endpoint-matching condition gives an injection into the disjoint union of pairs of chains, so
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m).
$$
This is the accepted chain-pair injection.

Combining this with the accepted cup/cap estimates gives the finite-level bound
$$
C_k(P_m)\le (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}
\qquad (k\ge 2).
$$
For $k=1$ we simply have
$$
C_1(P_m)=|P_m|=2^m.
$$

Therefore
$$
g(P_m)=C_1(P_m)+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} C_k(P_m)
\le 2^m+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}.
$$
The exponent
$$
\phi_m(k):=(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor
$$
is maximized for $k$ near $2m-1$, with maximum value $m^2+m+O(1)$, and it decreases quadratically away from that point. Hence the whole sum is bounded by a polynomial factor times $2^{m^2+m}$, and therefore
$$
g(P_m)\le 2^{m^2+m+O(\log m)}.
$$

Finally, extend from the special sizes $|P_m|=2^m$ to arbitrary $n\ge 1$. If $n=1$, then trivially $f(1)=1$. If $n\ge 2$, let
$$
M:=\lceil \log_2 n\rceil,
$$
so $M\ge 1$ and $|P_M|=2^M\ge n$. Choose any $n$-point subset $S\subseteq P_M$. Every convex subset of $S$ is also a convex subset of $P_M$, so
$$
g(S)\le g(P_M)\le 2^{M^2+M+O(\log M)}.
$$
Since $M=\log_2 n+O(1)$, this yields
$$
f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}
\qquad (n\ge 1).
$$

As for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim: the obstruction is exactly that total cup/cap counts do not by themselves control convex $k$-sets, because a convex $k$-set requires the upper and lower hull chains to have matching endpoints, while the aggregate quantities $Q_+$ and $Q_-$ forget that endpoint data.

Remaining proof-tightness issues: none seen in this corrected upper-bound note beyond the already-recorded endpoint-matching obstruction for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim.

# One-split endpoint-refined recurrence

Assume
$$
P=L\sqcup R
$$
satisfies the one-split hypotheses of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]: every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$, every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, and every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

## Definitions

For $a\ge 1$ and $\ell,\lambda\in L$, let
$$
\widetilde Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda)
$$
be the number of $a$-point caps in $L$ with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$, with the convention
$$
\widetilde Q_-(1,L;\ell,\ell)=1,\qquad
\widetilde Q_-(1,L;\ell,\lambda)=0\ \text{for }\ell\neq\lambda.
$$
For $a\ge 2$ this is just $Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda)$.

For $b\ge 1$ and $\rho,r\in R$, let
$$
\widetilde Q_+(b,R;\rho,r)
$$
be the number of $b$-point cups in $R$ with endpoints $(\rho,r)$, with the convention
$$
\widetilde Q_+(1,R;r,r)=1,\qquad
\widetilde Q_+(1,R;\rho,r)=0\ \text{for }\rho\neq r.
$$
For $b\ge 2$ this is just $Q_+(b,R;\rho,r)$.

For $a,b\ge 1$, define
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
$$
to be the number of spanning convex subsets $S\subseteq P$ such that
$$
|S\cap L|=a,\qquad |S\cap R|=b,
$$
the global leftmost and rightmost points of $S$ are $\ell$ and $r$, and
$$
\lambda=\max_x(S\cap L),\qquad \rho=\min_x(S\cap R).
$$
Equivalently, $S$ has state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

For fixed $k\ge 2$, set
$$
C^\times(k,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r):=\sum_{a+b=k} C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r).
$$

## Exact fixed-state factorization

**Proposition.** For every $a,b\ge 1$ and every admissible state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$,
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_+(b,R;\rho,r).
$$
Hence
$$
C^\times(k,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\sum_{a+b=k}\widetilde Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_+(b,R;\rho,r).
$$

**Proof.** By [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]], every spanning convex set $S$ with state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ decomposes uniquely as
$$
S=(S\cap L)\sqcup(S\cap R),
$$
where $S\cap L$ is a cap with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$ and $S\cap R$ is a cup with endpoints $(\rho,r)$. So
$$
S\mapsto (S\cap L,S\cap R)
$$
is injective into the Cartesian product on the right.

For surjectivity, let
$$
A=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_a=\lambda\}\subseteq L
$$
be such a cap and
$$
B=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_b=r\}\subseteq R
$$
be such a cup. Since $B$ is a cup and the line through $u_1,u_2$ lies strictly above every point of $L$, in particular above $\ell$,
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)<\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2)<\cdots<\operatorname{slope}(u_{b-1},u_b),
$$
with the evident truncation when $b=1$. Thus
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b
$$
is a cup from $\ell$ to $r$.

Dually, since $A$ is a cap and the line through $v_{a-1},v_a$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, in particular below $r$,
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_1,v_2)>\cdots>\operatorname{slope}(v_{a-1},v_a)>\operatorname{slope}(v_a,r),
$$
with the evident truncation when $a=1$. Thus
$$
v_1,\dots,v_a,r
$$
is a cap from $\ell$ to $r$.

Now every upper-chain edge with both endpoints in $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$. For the first upper edge $\ell\rho$, all points of $A$ lie on or below the chord $\ell\lambda$ because $A$ is a cap, and $\rho$ lies strictly above the line $\ell\lambda$ because $\ell,\lambda\in L$; hence the segment $\ell\rho$ lies strictly above every point of $A\setminus\{\ell\}$. The dual argument shows that every lower-chain edge lies strictly below every point of $B\setminus\{r\}$.

Therefore the upper hull of $A\cup B$ is
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b
$$
and the lower hull is
$$
v_1,\dots,v_a,r.
$$
So $A\cup B$ is in convex position, spanning, and has state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$. This proves surjectivity. $\square$

Thus the spanning-convex count with fixed state is an **exact product**, not merely an upper bound.

## Crossing specializations

The exact crossing identities of [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]] are the degenerate-state cases:
$$
C^\times(1,b,P;\ell,\ell,\rho,r)=\widetilde Q_+(b,R;\rho,r),
$$
$$
C^\times(a,1,P;\ell,\lambda,r,r)=\widetilde Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$
Summing over the free split endpoint gives, for $k\ge 2$,
$$
Q_+^\times(k,P;\ell,r)
=
\sum_{\rho\in R,\ \rho<r} C^\times(1,k-1,P;\ell,\ell,\rho,r)
=
\sum_{\rho\in R,\ \rho<r} Q_+(k-1,R;\rho,r),
$$
and
$$
Q_-^\times(k,P;\ell,r)
=
\sum_{\lambda\in L,\ \ell<\lambda} C^\times(k-1,1,P;\ell,\lambda,r,r)
=
\sum_{\lambda\in L,\ \ell<\lambda} Q_-(k-1,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$

## Recursive-family form

For the recursive family $P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m$ from [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]], the same formulas apply verbatim:
$$
C^\times(a,b,P_m;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_-(a,L_m;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_+(b,R_m;\rho,r),
$$
and
$$
C^\times(k,P_m;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\sum_{a+b=k}\widetilde Q_-(a,L_m;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_+(b,R_m;\rho,r).
$$

Endpoint matching is enforced by the state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ itself: it fixes both local endpoint pairs and the common global endpoints $(\ell,r)$, so only the uniquely compatible left cap and right cup are paired.

After this state is forgotten, one is back in the situation of [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]]: the remaining statements are only upper bounds, because unmatched endpoint choices can no longer be excluded exactly.
