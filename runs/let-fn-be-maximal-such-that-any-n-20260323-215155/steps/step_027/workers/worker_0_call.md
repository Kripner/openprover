# Task

Use [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]], [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]], and [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].

Work on exactly one task: identify the first place where exactness is lost when one passes from the exact fixed-state recurrence in the one-split model to the coarse recursive-family counting argument used for the upper bound.

Deliverable:
- Start from the exact state-level formula in [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]].
- Write the exact identity obtained after summing over all states/endpoints for spanning convex subsets in $P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m$ of a fixed split size $(a,b)$.
- Then compare that exact formula to the coarse quantities used in [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].
- Pin down the first projection/coarsening step where exactness is replaced by an inequality, and state precisely what endpoint/state information is being forgotten there.
- Say whether that specific loss is enough to explain why the current recursive-family argument still yields the exponent constant $1$, or whether the obstruction lies later.

Requirements:
- Keep the output as a short polished note suitable to store directly as one repo item.
- Be explicit about which formulas are exact identities and which are only inequalities.
- Do not do literature, Lean, or unrelated asymptotic optimization.
- Do not revisit the already-settled local gluing proof except insofar as needed to quote it.

## [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]]

Summary: For a fixed state in a one-split configuration, spanning convex subsets are counted exactly by a product of a left endpoint-refined cup count and a right endpoint-refined cap count; summing over states is also exact.

Assume the hypotheses of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]:
$$
P=L\sqcup R,
$$
every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$, every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, and every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

For a spanning convex subset $S\subseteq P$, write
$$
\ell=\min_x S,\qquad r=\max_x S,
$$
$$
\lambda=\max_x(S\cap L),\qquad \rho=\min_x(S\cap R).
$$
Call $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ the state of $S$.

For integers $a,b\ge 1$, let
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
$$
denote the number of spanning convex subsets $S\subseteq P$ with
$$
|S\cap L|=a,\qquad |S\cap R|=b,
$$
and state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

Define degenerate endpoint-refined local counts by
$$
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda):=
\begin{cases}
1,& a=1\text{ and }\ell=\lambda,\\
Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda),& a\ge 2\text{ and }\ell<\lambda,\\
0,&\text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
$$
and
$$
\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r):=
\begin{cases}
1,& b=1\text{ and }\rho=r,\\
Q_-(b,R;\rho,r),& b\ge 2\text{ and }\rho<r,\\
0,&\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

## Proposition

For every admissible state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ and every $a,b\ge 1$,
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r).
$$

Here the local quantities are a left cup count and a right cap count. Endpoint matching is enforced because fixing $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ forces the local endpoint pairs to be exactly $(\ell,\lambda)$ on $L$ and $(\rho,r)$ on $R$.

## Proof

Let $S$ be counted by $C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$, and list
$$
S\cap L=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_a=\lambda\},\qquad
S\cap R=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_b=r\}.
$$
By the explicit hull-chain formulas in [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]],
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_a,r,
\qquad
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b.
$$
Since $D(S)$ is a lower hull chain, its consecutive slopes are strictly increasing, so
$$
v_1,\dots,v_a
$$
is an $a$-cup in $L$ with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$ when $a\ge 2$, and when $a=1$ this says $\lambda=\ell$.
Since $U(S)$ is an upper hull chain, its consecutive slopes are strictly decreasing, so
$$
u_1,\dots,u_b
$$
is a $b$-cap in $R$ with endpoints $(\rho,r)$ when $b\ge 2$, and when $b=1$ this says $\rho=r$.

Thus
$$
\Phi(S):=(S\cap L,\;S\cap R)
$$
lands in the product counted by
$$
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r),
$$
and $\Phi$ is injective because
$$
S=(S\cap L)\sqcup(S\cap R).
$$

For surjectivity, let
$$
A=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_a=\lambda\}\subseteq L
$$
be counted by $\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)$ and let
$$
B=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_b=r\}\subseteq R
$$
be counted by $\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r)$. Set $S:=A\cup B$.

If $a\ge 2$, then $A$ is an $a$-cup, so
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_1,v_2)<\cdots<\operatorname{slope}(v_{a-1},v_a).
$$
Because $v_{a-1},v_a\in L$, every point of $R$, in particular $r$, lies strictly above the line through $v_{a-1},v_a$. Since
$$
x_{v_{a-1}}<x_{v_a}<x_r,
$$
this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_{a-1},v_a)<\operatorname{slope}(v_a,r).
$$
Hence
$$
v_1,\dots,v_a,r
$$
is an $(a+1)$-cup. For $a=1$ this chain is just $\ell,r$.

If $b\ge 2$, then $B$ is a $b$-cap, so
$$
\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2)>\cdots>\operatorname{slope}(u_{b-1},u_b).
$$
Because $u_1,u_2\in R$, every point of $L$, in particular $\ell$, lies strictly below the line through $u_1,u_2$. Since
$$
x_\ell<x_{u_1}<x_{u_2},
$$
this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)>\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2).
$$
Hence
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b
$$
is a $(b+1)$-cap. For $b=1$ this chain is just $\ell,r$.

Therefore
$$
\ell=v_1,\dots,v_a,r
$$
is a lower cup-chain and
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b=r
$$
is an upper cap-chain with the same endpoints $(\ell,r)$. The cup-chain has all interior vertices strictly below the chord $\ell r$, and the cap-chain has all interior vertices strictly above $\ell r$, so they meet only at $\ell$ and $r$. Hence the boundary of $\operatorname{conv}(S)$ is exactly the concatenation of these two chains, so $S$ is in convex position. Its state is plainly $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

Thus $\Phi$ is surjective, hence bijective, and
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r).
$$
$\square$

## State Sum

Summing over states gives an exact identity, not merely an inequality. Every spanning convex subset has a unique state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$, so the families counted by
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
$$
are disjoint and their union is exactly the family of spanning convex subsets with $|S\cap L|=a$ and $|S\cap R|=b$. Therefore the state sum is exact.

The previous draft failed because it attached the wrong local types: with a left cap and a right cup, the bridge inequalities across the split point the wrong way, so the claimed gluing map is not bijective. With the corrected left-cup/right-cap assignment, the same split inequalities give exactly the needed extensions.


## [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]]

Summary: Under the one-split hypotheses, every spanning cup has exactly one left point and every spanning cap exactly one right point, yielding exact endpoint-refined crossing identities.

Assume the hypotheses of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]: namely
$$
P=L\sqcup R,
$$
every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$, every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, and every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

For $t\ge 2$ and points $a,b$ of a planar point set $X$, write $Q_+(t,X;a,b)$ for the number of $t$-cups in $X$ whose left and right endpoints are $a,b$, and $Q_-(t,X;a,b)$ for the number of $t$-caps in $X$ whose left and right endpoints are $a,b$. Equivalently, in left-to-right order, the consecutive slopes of a cup are strictly increasing and those of a cap are strictly decreasing.

For $\ell\in L$, $r\in R$, and $t\ge 2$, write $Q_+^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)$ for the number of spanning $(t+1)$-cups $S\subseteq P$ with global endpoints $(\ell,r)$. Define $Q_-^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)$ analogously for spanning caps.

**Proposition.**
Under the one-split hypotheses, the following hold.

1. If $S\subseteq P$ is a spanning cup with global endpoints $(\ell,r)$, then
$$
S\cap L=\{\ell\}.
$$
So every spanning cup has exactly one point in the left half, namely its global left endpoint.

2. If $S\subseteq P$ is a spanning cap with global endpoints $(\ell,r)$, then
$$
S\cap R=\{r\}.
$$
So every spanning cap has exactly one point in the right half, namely its global right endpoint.

3. Consequently, for every $\ell\in L$, $r\in R$, and $t\ge 2$,
$$
Q_+^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\rho\in R,\ \rho<r} Q_+(t,R;\rho,r),
$$
and
$$
Q_-^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\lambda\in L,\ \ell<\lambda} Q_-(t,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$

Here $\rho<r$ and $\ell<\lambda$ refer to the left-to-right $x$-order.

**Proof.**
Let $S\subseteq P$ be spanning, and use the notation of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]:
$$
\ell=\min_x S,\qquad r=\max_x S,
$$
$$
\lambda=\max_x(S\cap L),\qquad \rho=\min_x(S\cap R).
$$
That lemma shows that $S\cap L$ is a cap with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$, $S\cap R$ is a cup with endpoints $(\rho,r)$, and if
$$
S\cap L=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_s=\lambda\},
$$
then
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r,
$$
while if
$$
S\cap R=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_t=r\},
$$
then
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t.
$$

Now suppose that $S$ is itself a cup. Then its lower hull has only the two global endpoints $\ell,r$. Comparing with
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r
$$
forces $s=1$, hence $\lambda=\ell$ and
$$
S\cap L=\{\ell\}.
$$
This proves (1).

The proof of (2) is dual. If $S$ is a spanning cap, then its upper hull has only the two global endpoints $\ell,r$. Comparing with
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t
$$
forces $t=1$, hence $\rho=r$ and
$$
S\cap R=\{r\}.
$$

For the counting identities, fix $\ell\in L$, $r\in R$, and $t\ge 2$.

For cups, define
$$
\Phi(S)=S\cap R.
$$
By (1), this gives a map from spanning $(t+1)$-cups with endpoints $(\ell,r)$ into the disjoint union over $\rho\in R$ with $\rho<r$ of the sets of $t$-cups in $R$ with endpoints $(\rho,r)$. It is injective because
$$
S=\{\ell\}\sqcup \Phi(S).
$$

To prove surjectivity, let
$$
T=\{u_1=\rho<u_2<\cdots<u_t=r\}\subseteq R
$$
be a $t$-cup, and set
$$
S:=\{\ell\}\cup T.
$$
Since $T$ is a cup,
$$
\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2)<\operatorname{slope}(u_2,u_3)<\cdots<\operatorname{slope}(u_{t-1},u_t).
$$
Also, $u_1,u_2\in R$, so the line through $u_1,u_2$ lies strictly above every point of $L$, in particular above $\ell$. Because $x_\ell<x_{u_1}<x_{u_2}$, this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)<\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2).
$$
Hence
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)
<
\operatorname{slope}(u_1,u_2)
<
\cdots
<
\operatorname{slope}(u_{t-1},u_t),
$$
so
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t
$$
is a $(t+1)$-cup with endpoints $(\ell,r)$. This includes the case $t=2$: one only uses
$$
\operatorname{slope}(\ell,u_1)<\operatorname{slope}(u_1,r),
$$
so no separate interior-point argument is needed.

Therefore $\Phi$ is bijective, and taking cardinalities gives
$$
Q_+^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\rho\in R,\ \rho<r} Q_+(t,R;\rho,r).
$$

The cap identity is dual. Let
$$
T=\{v_1=\ell<v_2<\cdots<v_t=\lambda\}\subseteq L
$$
be a $t$-cap, and set
$$
S:=T\cup\{r\}.
$$
Since $T$ is a cap,
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_1,v_2)>\operatorname{slope}(v_2,v_3)>\cdots>\operatorname{slope}(v_{t-1},v_t).
$$
Also, $v_{t-1},v_t\in L$, so the line through $v_{t-1},v_t$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, in particular below $r$. Because $x_{v_{t-1}}<x_{v_t}<x_r$, this is equivalent to
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_{t-1},v_t)>\operatorname{slope}(v_t,r).
$$
Hence
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_1,v_2)>
\cdots>
\operatorname{slope}(v_{t-1},v_t)>
\operatorname{slope}(v_t,r),
$$
so
$$
v_1,\dots,v_t,r
$$
is a $(t+1)$-cap with endpoints $(\ell,r)$. Thus
$$
Q_-^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)=\sum_{\lambda\in L,\ \ell<\lambda} Q_-(t,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$

Endpoint matching is enforced because the global outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$ are fixed, while the split lemma recovers uniquely the first right-side vertex $\rho$ for cups and the last left-side vertex $\lambda$ for caps. $\square$

## [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]]

Summary: Verified upper bound via a recursively separated family showing $f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}$.

Let $P_1$ be a two-point set, and for $m\ge 2$ let
$$
P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m
$$
where $L_m$ and $R_m$ are affine copies of $P_{m-1}$ in the standard recursively separated position. Thus
$$
|P_m|=2^m \qquad (m\ge 1).
$$

For each fixed $m$, we may first apply a sufficiently small generic rotation to $P_m$ so that all points of $P_m$ have distinct $x$-coordinates. This does not change the order type, hence does not change which subsets are in convex position. After this normalization, for $r\ge 2$ let $Q_+(r,P_m)$ and $Q_-(r,P_m)$ denote respectively the numbers of $r$-cups and $r$-caps in $P_m$. For $k\ge 1$, let $C_k(P_m)$ be the number of $k$-point subsets of $P_m$ in convex position, and set
$$
g(P_m):=\sum_{k=1}^{2^m} C_k(P_m).
$$

We first record the cup/cap bound.

**Lemma.** For each $r\ge 2$ there is a constant $d_r>0$ such that
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le d_r\,2^{rm}\qquad\text{for all }m\ge 1.
$$

**Proof.** The base case $r=2$ is explicit:
$$
Q_+(2,P_m)=Q_-(2,P_m)=\binom{2^m}{2}\le 2^{2m},
$$
so we may take $d_2=1$.

Now fix $r\ge 3$ and assume $d_{r-1}$ has already been chosen. For $m=1$ we have $Q_\pm(r,P_1)=0$, since $|P_1|=2<r$. For $m\ge 2$, every $r$-cup in $P_m$ is either contained entirely in $L_m$ or entirely in $R_m$, or else consists of one point from one side together with an $(r-1)$-cup from the other side; the same dichotomy holds for $r$-caps. Hence
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le 2\,Q_\pm(r,P_{m-1})+2^{m-1}Q_\pm(r-1,P_{m-1}).
$$
Choose $d_r$ so that
$$
(2^r-2)d_r\ge d_{r-1}.
$$
Then, using the inductive bounds in $m$ and in $r$,
\[
\begin{aligned}
Q_\pm(r,P_m)
&\le 2d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}+2^{m-1}d_{r-1}\,2^{(r-1)(m-1)} \\
&= \bigl(2d_r+d_{r-1}\bigr)2^{r(m-1)}
 \le 2^r d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}
 = d_r\,2^{rm}.
\end{aligned}
\]
This proves the claim. $\square$

Now let $k\ge 2$. Every convex $k$-subset $S\subseteq P_m$ has a unique leftmost point and a unique rightmost point. Along the upper hull from left to right one obtains an $a$-cup for some $2\le a\le k$, and along the lower hull one obtains a $(k+2-a)$-cap. Forgetting the endpoint-matching condition gives an injection into the disjoint union of pairs of chains, so
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m).
$$
This is the accepted chain-pair injection.

Combining this with the accepted cup/cap estimates gives the finite-level bound
$$
C_k(P_m)\le (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}
\qquad (k\ge 2).
$$
For $k=1$ we simply have
$$
C_1(P_m)=|P_m|=2^m.
$$

Therefore
$$
g(P_m)=C_1(P_m)+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} C_k(P_m)
\le 2^m+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}.
$$
The exponent
$$
\phi_m(k):=(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor
$$
is maximized for $k$ near $2m-1$, with maximum value $m^2+m+O(1)$, and it decreases quadratically away from that point. Hence the whole sum is bounded by a polynomial factor times $2^{m^2+m}$, and therefore
$$
g(P_m)\le 2^{m^2+m+O(\log m)}.
$$

Finally, extend from the special sizes $|P_m|=2^m$ to arbitrary $n\ge 1$. If $n=1$, then trivially $f(1)=1$. If $n\ge 2$, let
$$
M:=\lceil \log_2 n\rceil,
$$
so $M\ge 1$ and $|P_M|=2^M\ge n$. Choose any $n$-point subset $S\subseteq P_M$. Every convex subset of $S$ is also a convex subset of $P_M$, so
$$
g(S)\le g(P_M)\le 2^{M^2+M+O(\log M)}.
$$
Since $M=\log_2 n+O(1)$, this yields
$$
f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}
\qquad (n\ge 1).
$$

As for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim: the obstruction is exactly that total cup/cap counts do not by themselves control convex $k$-sets, because a convex $k$-set requires the upper and lower hull chains to have matching endpoints, while the aggregate quantities $Q_+$ and $Q_-$ forget that endpoint data.

Remaining proof-tightness issues: none seen in this corrected upper-bound note beyond the already-recorded endpoint-matching obstruction for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim.

# Recursive-family Information Loss

Let
$$
C_m^\times(a,b)
:=
\#\{S\subseteq P_m:\ S\text{ is in convex position},\ |S\cap L_m|=a,\ |S\cap R_m|=b\},
$$
for $a,b\ge 1$, where $P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m$ is the one-split decomposition from [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].

By [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]], for each state
$$
(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
\quad
(\ell,\lambda\in L_m,\ \rho,r\in R_m),
$$
one has the exact identity
$$
C^\times(a,b,P_m;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_+(a,L_m;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R_m;\rho,r).
$$
Summing over all states gives another exact identity:
$$
\begin{aligned}
C_m^\times(a,b)
&=
\sum_{\ell,\lambda\in L_m}\sum_{\rho,r\in R_m}
C^\times(a,b,P_m;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r) \\
&=
\sum_{\ell,\lambda\in L_m}\sum_{\rho,r\in R_m}
\widetilde Q_+(a,L_m;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R_m;\rho,r).
\end{aligned}
$$
Here the degenerate conventions already enforce $\ell=\lambda$ when $a=1$ and $\rho=r$ when $b=1$, so no further correction is needed. Since the left and right endpoint variables are independent in the one-split gluing, this factors exactly as
$$
C_m^\times(a,b)
=
\Bigl(\sum_{\ell,\lambda\in L_m}\widetilde Q_+(a,L_m;\ell,\lambda)\Bigr)
\Bigl(\sum_{\rho,r\in R_m}\widetilde Q_-(b,R_m;\rho,r)\Bigr).
$$
Thus the passage from state counts to fixed split-size counts loses no information at all. In particular, the inner state data $(\lambda,\rho)$ are summed out exactly.

The same point persists when one passes to the crossing cup/cap families from [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]]: the split-side extension step is still an exact summation over the relevant endpoint parameter, not yet an inequality. So the displayed recursive inequalities for $Q_\pm(r,P_m)$ in [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]] are coarse rewritings of a decomposition that can still be kept exact at that stage.

The first genuine loss of exactness occurs later, when one replaces matched endpoint-refined hull counts by the coarse totals $Q_+(t,P_m)$ and $Q_-(u,P_m)$. For convex $k$-subsets there is an exact endpoint-refined identity
$$
C_k(P_m)
=
\sum_{a=2}^k\ \sum_{\ell<r}
Q_+(a,P_m;\ell,r)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m;\ell,r),
$$
where the cup and cap are required to have the same global endpoints $(\ell,r)$. The upper-bound note then replaces this by
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m),
$$
which is only an inequality. This is the first projection where exactness is actually lost: one forgets that the upper-hull cup and lower-hull cap must share the same outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$. Relative to the state-level formula, one has first forgotten the interior bridge data $(\lambda,\rho)$ by exact summation, and then here one forgets the remaining matched endpoint data $(\ell,r)$ by inequality.

This loss is not, by itself, enough to explain why the recursive-family argument still gives exponent constant $1$. Even before this inequality, the exact one-split formula has already collapsed to a product of total left-cup and right-cap counts, and the available cup/cap bounds are still of size $2^{rm+O(1)}$. Plugging those bounds into either the exact split formula or the coarse chain-pair inequality leads to the same $m^2+O(m)$ exponent scale. So the real obstruction is later: the method has no sharper control on the matched-endpoint quantities than on the aggregate cup/cap totals, and without new structure beyond those totals the exponent constant does not improve.
