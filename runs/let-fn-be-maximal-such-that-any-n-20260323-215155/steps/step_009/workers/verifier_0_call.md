# Original Task

Let
$$
f(n)=\min_{|P|=n} \#\{A\subseteq P:\ A\text{ is in convex position}\}.
$$
I need a clean, self-contained proof of a lower bound of order $2^{c(\log n)^2}$ using only Erdős-Szekeres-type input.

Please do exactly this one task:

1. For fixed $k$, prove rigorously that every $n$-point set $P$ in general position satisfies
$$
\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{ES(k),k}},
$$
where $\mathrm{conv}_k(P)$ is the number of $k$-point subsets of $P$ in convex position and $ES(k)$ is the Erdős-Szekeres number.
Use a precise double-counting argument over all $ES(k)$-subsets of $P$.

2. Combine this with Suk's bound
$$
ES(k)=2^{k+o(k)}
$$
to derive a lower bound on the total number of convex subsets:
$$
f(n)\ge 2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}.
$$
Choose and optimize $k$ explicitly as a function of $n$.

3. State the final result carefully in both forms:
- base-2 logarithms;
- natural logarithms.

4. Keep the writeup focused on the lower bound only. I do not need discussion of upper bounds or literature history beyond citing the needed input $ES(k)=2^{k+o(k)}$.

Deliver a proof-quality writeup with all asymptotic steps justified clearly enough to store directly as a repo item.

# Worker Output

A small correction is needed in part 1: the displayed inequality is only true when $n\ge ES(k)$. For $n<ES(k)$ it can fail (indeed, there are $(ES(k)-1)$-point sets with no $k$ points in convex position). This is the only range needed for the asymptotic lower bound.

Let
\[
g(P):=\#\{A\subseteq P:\ A\text{ is in convex position}\},
\qquad
\mathrm{conv}_k(P):=\#\{A\subseteq P:\ |A|=k,\ A\text{ is in convex position}\}.
\]
Then $f(n)=\min_{|P|=n} g(P)$.

**Proposition.** Fix $k\ge 3$, and put $m:=ES(k)$. If $P$ is an $n$-point set in general position with $n\ge m$, then
\[
\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{m}{k}}.
\]

**Proof.** Consider
\[
\mathcal X:=\{(A,Q): A\subseteq Q\subseteq P,\ |A|=k,\ |Q|=m,\ A\text{ is in convex position}\}.
\]
We count $\mathcal X$ in two ways.

First, fix an $m$-subset $Q\subseteq P$. By the definition of $m=ES(k)$, every such $Q$ contains at least one $k$-subset in convex position. Hence each $Q$ contributes at least one pair $(A,Q)$, so
\[
|\mathcal X|\ge \binom{n}{m}.
\]

Second, fix a convex $k$-subset $A\subseteq P$. The number of $m$-subsets $Q\subseteq P$ containing $A$ is exactly
\[
\binom{n-k}{m-k}.
\]
Therefore
\[
|\mathcal X|=\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\binom{n-k}{m-k}.
\]

Comparing the two counts gives
\[
\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\binom{n-k}{m-k}\ge \binom{n}{m},
\]
hence
\[
\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{m}}{\binom{n-k}{m-k}}
=\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{m}{k}}.
\]
The last identity is the standard binomial identity
\[
\binom{n}{m}\binom{m}{k}=\binom{n}{k}\binom{n-k}{m-k}.
\]
This proves the proposition. ∎

As a consequence, for every $k$ with $ES(k)\le n$ and every $n$-point set $P$,
\[
g(P)\ge \mathrm{conv}_k(P)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{ES(k)}{k}},
\]
so
\[
f(n)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{ES(k)}{k}}.
\]

**Asymptotic choice of $k$.** Write
\[
ES(k)=2^{k+\varepsilon_k k},\qquad \varepsilon_k\to 0,
\]
which is exactly Suk’s bound $ES(k)=2^{k+o(k)}$.

Let
\[
L:=\log_2 n,\qquad k:=\Big\lfloor \frac{L}{2}\Big\rfloor.
\]
Then $k=(\tfrac12+o(1))L$, so
\[
\log_2 ES(k)=k+\varepsilon_k k=(\tfrac12+o(1))L<L
\]
for all sufficiently large $n$. Thus $ES(k)\le n$, and the previous bound applies.

Now
\[
\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{ES(k)}{k}}
=\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}\frac{n-i}{ES(k)-i}
\ge \left(\frac{n-k+1}{ES(k)}\right)^k.
\]
Taking $\log_2$,
\[
\log_2 f(n)\ge k\bigl(\log_2(n-k+1)-\log_2 ES(k)\bigr).
\]
Since $k=O(\log n)=o(n)$, we have $\log_2(n-k+1)=L+o(1)$. Also $\log_2 ES(k)=k+\varepsilon_k k$. Therefore
\[
\log_2 f(n)\ge k\bigl(L-k-\varepsilon_k k+o(1)\bigr).
\]
Now
\[
kL-k^2=\frac14L^2+O(L),
\qquad
\varepsilon_k k^2=o(L^2),
\qquad
k\cdot o(1)=o(L),
\]
so
\[
\log_2 f(n)\ge \frac14L^2-o(L^2).
\]
Equivalently,
\[
f(n)\ge 2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}.
\]

This choice of $k$ is asymptotically optimal for this argument: if $k=\alpha \log_2 n$, then the main term is
\[
(\alpha-\alpha^2)(\log_2 n)^2,
\]
maximized at $\alpha=\tfrac12$.

**Final forms.**

Using base-$2$ logarithms:
\[
f(n)\ge 2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}.
\]

Using natural logarithms:
\[
f(n)\ge \exp\!\left(\left(\frac{1}{4\ln 2}-o(1)\right)(\ln n)^2\right).
\]

Indeed,
\[
2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}
=\exp\!\left((\tfrac14-o(1))\ln 2\cdot \frac{(\ln n)^2}{(\ln 2)^2}\right)
=\exp\!\left(\left(\frac{1}{4\ln 2}-o(1)\right)(\ln n)^2\right).
\]

So the Erdős-Szekeres input alone yields the lower bound
\[
f(n)\ge 2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}
=\exp\!\left(\left(\frac{1}{4\ln 2}-o(1)\right)(\ln n)^2\right).
\]

# Your Task

Independently verify the worker's output above. Do not verify formal Lean code - focus on informal reasoning, logical correctness, and whether the task was completed as requested.

======== RESPONSE ========

The worker’s mathematics is sound, with one necessary correction to the original prompt: the inequality
$$
\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{ES(k)}{k}}
$$
is not true for all $n$; it requires $n\ge ES(k)$. The worker correctly points this out, and for the asymptotic lower bound this is the only regime needed.

The double count is correct. For $m=ES(k)$, counting
$$
\mathcal X=\{(A,Q): A\subseteq Q\subseteq P,\ |A|=k,\ |Q|=m,\ A\text{ convex}\}
$$
gives
$$
|\mathcal X|\ge \binom{n}{m}
$$
because every $m$-subset $Q$ contains at least one convex $k$-subset, and also
$$
|\mathcal X|=\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\binom{n-k}{m-k}.
$$
Using
$$
\binom{n}{m}\binom{m}{k}=\binom{n}{k}\binom{n-k}{m-k}
$$
yields
$$
\mathrm{conv}_k(P)\ge \frac{\binom{n}{k}}{\binom{m}{k}}.
$$

The asymptotic part is also correct. Writing $ES(k)=2^{k+\varepsilon_k k}$ with $\varepsilon_k\to 0$, taking $k=\lfloor \tfrac12\log_2 n\rfloor$, one has $ES(k)\le n$ for all sufficiently large $n$, and
$$
\log_2 f(n)\ge k\bigl(\log_2(n-k+1)-\log_2 ES(k)\bigr)
= \frac14(\log_2 n)^2-o\bigl((\log n)^2\bigr).
$$
So
$$
f(n)\ge 2^{(\frac14-o(1))(\log_2 n)^2},
$$
and converting bases gives
$$
f(n)\ge \exp\!\left(\left(\frac{1}{4\ln 2}-o(1)\right)(\ln n)^2\right).
$$
That conversion is correct.

VERDICT: CORRECT
