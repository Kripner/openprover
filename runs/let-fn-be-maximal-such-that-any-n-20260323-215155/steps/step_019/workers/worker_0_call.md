======== SYSTEM PROMPT ========

You are a research mathematician working on a specific task.

Think carefully before writing your answer. Explore the problem, consider edge cases, and work through the reasoning step by step before stating conclusions.

Complete the task thoroughly and report your findings. If you get stuck, return what you have so far - partial progress is valuable. Clearly state what you found, where you got stuck, and what remains open. The planner will decide whether to continue from your progress or try a different approach.

If asked to verify a proof: be rigorous. Check every step. Don't fill in gaps yourself. End your response with exactly one of:
VERDICT: CORRECT
VERDICT: INCORRECT

Write in concise mathematical style. Use $inline$ and $$display$$ LaTeX.

IMPORTANT: You are a single worker. Do NOT attempt to spawn subagents, delegate to other workers, or "launch agents in parallel". You do all the work yourself, directly in your response.

# Task

Work only on the recursive construction from [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].

Context:
- $P_1$ is a two-point set.
- For $m\ge 2$, $P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m$ where $L_m,R_m$ are affine copies of $P_{m-1}$ in the standard recursively separated position, so $|P_m|=2^m$.
- The current upper bound comes from the coarse inequality
  $$
  C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m),
  $$
  which loses endpoint information and gives only constant $1$ in the exponent.
- The issue is that a convex $k$-set has common leftmost/rightmost endpoints for its upper and lower hull chains.

Your single task:
Define the smallest useful family of endpoint-refined quantities that remembers common endpoints, and derive the sharpest rigorous recurrence you can for those quantities under the split $P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m$.

Keep this narrow. Do not try to finish the whole problem unless the recurrence itself immediately gives the bound.

Deliverable:
- precise definitions of the endpoint-refined counts;
- rigorous recurrence(s) under $P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m$;
- either:
  1. a clean deduction of an improved upper bound for convex $k$-sets / total convex subsets, or
  2. a clear obstruction showing why even this endpoint-sensitive recurrence does not beat the current constant.

Requirements:
1. Stay entirely on the construction side; no literature.
2. One focused note only: recurrence plus consequence/obstruction.
3. Be explicit about why the defined quantities correctly enforce endpoint matching.
4. Do not write Lean.

Return a self-contained note suitable to store as a lemma item or failed-attempt item.

## [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]]

Summary: Verified upper bound via a recursively separated family showing $f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}$.

Let $P_1$ be a two-point set, and for $m\ge 2$ let
$$
P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m
$$
where $L_m$ and $R_m$ are affine copies of $P_{m-1}$ in the standard recursively separated position. Thus
$$
|P_m|=2^m \qquad (m\ge 1).
$$

For each fixed $m$, we may first apply a sufficiently small generic rotation to $P_m$ so that all points of $P_m$ have distinct $x$-coordinates. This does not change the order type, hence does not change which subsets are in convex position. After this normalization, for $r\ge 2$ let $Q_+(r,P_m)$ and $Q_-(r,P_m)$ denote respectively the numbers of $r$-cups and $r$-caps in $P_m$. For $k\ge 1$, let $C_k(P_m)$ be the number of $k$-point subsets of $P_m$ in convex position, and set
$$
g(P_m):=\sum_{k=1}^{2^m} C_k(P_m).
$$

We first record the cup/cap bound.

**Lemma.** For each $r\ge 2$ there is a constant $d_r>0$ such that
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le d_r\,2^{rm}\qquad\text{for all }m\ge 1.
$$

**Proof.** The base case $r=2$ is explicit:
$$
Q_+(2,P_m)=Q_-(2,P_m)=\binom{2^m}{2}\le 2^{2m},
$$
so we may take $d_2=1$.

Now fix $r\ge 3$ and assume $d_{r-1}$ has already been chosen. For $m=1$ we have $Q_\pm(r,P_1)=0$, since $|P_1|=2<r$. For $m\ge 2$, every $r$-cup in $P_m$ is either contained entirely in $L_m$ or entirely in $R_m$, or else consists of one point from one side together with an $(r-1)$-cup from the other side; the same dichotomy holds for $r$-caps. Hence
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le 2\,Q_\pm(r,P_{m-1})+2^{m-1}Q_\pm(r-1,P_{m-1}).
$$
Choose $d_r$ so that
$$
(2^r-2)d_r\ge d_{r-1}.
$$
Then, using the inductive bounds in $m$ and in $r$,
\[
\begin{aligned}
Q_\pm(r,P_m)
&\le 2d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}+2^{m-1}d_{r-1}\,2^{(r-1)(m-1)} \\
&= \bigl(2d_r+d_{r-1}\bigr)2^{r(m-1)}
 \le 2^r d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}
 = d_r\,2^{rm}.
\end{aligned}
\]
This proves the claim. $\square$

Now let $k\ge 2$. Every convex $k$-subset $S\subseteq P_m$ has a unique leftmost point and a unique rightmost point. Along the upper hull from left to right one obtains an $a$-cup for some $2\le a\le k$, and along the lower hull one obtains a $(k+2-a)$-cap. Forgetting the endpoint-matching condition gives an injection into the disjoint union of pairs of chains, so
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m).
$$
This is the accepted chain-pair injection.

Combining this with the accepted cup/cap estimates gives the finite-level bound
$$
C_k(P_m)\le (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}
\qquad (k\ge 2).
$$
For $k=1$ we simply have
$$
C_1(P_m)=|P_m|=2^m.
$$

Therefore
$$
g(P_m)=C_1(P_m)+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} C_k(P_m)
\le 2^m+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}.
$$
The exponent
$$
\phi_m(k):=(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor
$$
is maximized for $k$ near $2m-1$, with maximum value $m^2+m+O(1)$, and it decreases quadratically away from that point. Hence the whole sum is bounded by a polynomial factor times $2^{m^2+m}$, and therefore
$$
g(P_m)\le 2^{m^2+m+O(\log m)}.
$$

Finally, extend from the special sizes $|P_m|=2^m$ to arbitrary $n\ge 1$. If $n=1$, then trivially $f(1)=1$. If $n\ge 2$, let
$$
M:=\lceil \log_2 n\rceil,
$$
so $M\ge 1$ and $|P_M|=2^M\ge n$. Choose any $n$-point subset $S\subseteq P_M$. Every convex subset of $S$ is also a convex subset of $P_M$, so
$$
g(S)\le g(P_M)\le 2^{M^2+M+O(\log M)}.
$$
Since $M=\log_2 n+O(1)$, this yields
$$
f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}
\qquad (n\ge 1).
$$

As for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim: the obstruction is exactly that total cup/cap counts do not by themselves control convex $k$-sets, because a convex $k$-set requires the upper and lower hull chains to have matching endpoints, while the aggregate quantities $Q_+$ and $Q_-$ forget that endpoint data.

Remaining proof-tightness issues: none seen in this corrected upper-bound note beyond the already-recorded endpoint-matching obstruction for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim.
