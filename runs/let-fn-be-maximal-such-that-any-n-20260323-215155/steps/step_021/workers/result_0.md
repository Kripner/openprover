Let
$$
P=L\sqcup R
$$
be a finite planar point set. After a sufficiently small generic rotation, assume that all points of $P$ have distinct $x$-coordinates, and that:

1. every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$;
2. every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$;
3. every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

These are the only geometric properties of the recursive split used below.

For a subset $S\subset P$ in convex position, write $U(S)$ and $D(S)$ for the upper and lower hull chains of $S$, both listed from left to right.

**Lemma.** Let $S\subset P$ be in convex position and assume
$$
S\cap L\neq\varnothing,\qquad S\cap R\neq\varnothing.
$$
Let
$$
\ell=\text{leftmost point of }S,\qquad r=\text{rightmost point of }S,
$$
and let
$$
\lambda=\text{rightmost point of }(S\cap L),\qquad
\rho=\text{leftmost point of }(S\cap R).
$$
Then:

1. $\ell\in L$ and $r\in R$.
2. $U(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $L$, namely $\ell$.
3. $D(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $R$, namely $r$.

Consequently, if the points of $S\cap R$ are listed in increasing $x$-order as
$$
\rho=u_1,\dots,u_t=r,
$$
then
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t.
$$
Likewise, if the points of $S\cap L$ are listed in increasing $x$-order as
$$
\ell=v_1,\dots,v_s=\lambda,
$$
then
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r.
$$
Equivalently, $S\cap R$ is exactly the upper-hull chain in $R$ from $\rho$ to $r$, and $S\cap L$ is exactly the lower-hull chain in $L$ from $\ell$ to $\lambda$.

In particular,
$$
S=(\text{cap in }L\text{ with endpoints }(\ell,\lambda))
\sqcup
(\text{cup in }R\text{ with endpoints }(\rho,r)),
$$
with the degenerate cases $\ell=\lambda$ and $\rho=r$ allowed.

**Proof.** By hypothesis (1), every point of $L$ has smaller $x$-coordinate than every point of $R$. Since $S$ meets both halves, its leftmost point lies in $L$ and its rightmost point lies in $R$, so $\ell\in L$ and $r\in R$.

Because all $x$-coordinates are distinct, each of the hull chains $U(S)$ and $D(S)$ is strictly monotone in $x$. Hence on either chain every vertex from $L$ appears before every vertex from $R$.

Suppose that $U(S)$ contains at least two vertices from $L$. Let $p,q$ be the last two such vertices along $U(S)$ from left to right. They are consecutive on $U(S)$: any vertex between them on that chain would have $x$-coordinate between those of $p$ and $q$, hence by the left-right separation would also lie in $L$, contradicting the choice of $p,q$ as the last two $L$-vertices. Since $pq$ is an edge of the upper hull of $S$, every point of $S$ lies on or below the line through $p,q$. But $p,q\in L$, so hypothesis (2) says that every point of $R$, hence every point of $S\cap R$, lies strictly above that line. This contradicts $S\cap R\neq\varnothing$. Therefore $U(S)$ contains at most one vertex from $L$, and since $\ell\in U(S)\cap L$, it contains exactly one such vertex, namely $\ell$.

The lower-hull statement is symmetric. If $D(S)$ contained at least two vertices from $R$, let $p,q$ be the first two such vertices along $D(S)$ from left to right. Again they are consecutive on $D(S)$, because any intermediate vertex would also have to lie in $R$. Since $pq$ is an edge of the lower hull, every point of $S$ lies on or above the line through $p,q$. But $p,q\in R$, so hypothesis (3) implies that every point of $L$, hence every point of $S\cap L$, lies strictly below that line, contradiction. Thus $D(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $R$, namely $r$.

Now use the correct endpoint-aware hull decomposition: every non-endpoint of $S$ lies on exactly one of the two chains $U(S),D(S)$, while the common endpoints $\ell,r$ lie on both. Since the only $R$-vertex on $D(S)$ is the endpoint $r$, every point of $S\cap R\setminus\{r\}$ lies on $U(S)$. Hence all points of $S\cap R$ occur on $U(S)$, and by $x$-monotonicity they appear there exactly in increasing $x$-order, from $\rho$ to $r$. This gives
$$
U(S)=\ell,u_1,\dots,u_t.
$$
Similarly, since the only $L$-vertex on $U(S)$ is the endpoint $\ell$, every point of $S\cap L\setminus\{\ell\}$ lies on $D(S)$, so the points of $S\cap L$ appear on $D(S)$ exactly in increasing $x$-order from $\ell$ to $\lambda$, giving
$$
D(S)=v_1,\dots,v_s,r.
$$
The cap-cup decomposition follows immediately. $\square$

For a later recurrence, the minimal endpoint/state data is
$$
(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r),
$$
equivalently a left-cap state indexed by $(\ell,\lambda)$ together with a right-cup state indexed by $(\rho,r)$. The outer entries $\ell$ and $r$ are the global leftmost and rightmost points of the spanning convex set, while $\lambda$ and $\rho$ record the terminal vertices of the left and right local chains at the split. Thus this state retains exactly the global-endpoint information lost by the aggregate counts $Q_+$ and $Q_-$, and it is enough to enforce common global endpoints when the two sides are combined.

I was not able to write this into the workspace because the local tool wrapper is failing with `bwrap: Unknown option --argv0`.
