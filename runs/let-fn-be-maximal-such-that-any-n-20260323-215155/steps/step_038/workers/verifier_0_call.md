# Original Task

Use [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]], [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]], [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]], and [[status/fixed-lag-separated-recursions-obstruction]] only as binary background.

Work on exactly one task: analyze a single geometric split with three blocks in left-middle-right separated position, and classify the convex subsets that meet more than one block.

Setup:
- Consider three point sets $L,M,R$ in general position.
- Assume a clean ternary separated geometry: all $x$-coordinates in $L$ are left of those in $M$, which are left of those in $R$; and the blocks are placed so that every line through two points of an earlier block lies above every later block, and every line through two points of a later block lies below every earlier block, in the natural left-to-right sense needed to force monotone hull behavior.
- If this formulation is not quite the right one, replace it by a precise equivalent geometric hypothesis that makes the structure theorem true.

Deliverable:
1. State a precise ternary one-split lemma for convex subsets of $L\sqcup M\sqcup R$.
2. Classify separately:
   - subsets meeting exactly two blocks;
   - subsets meeting all three blocks.
3. Identify the exact chain types involved on each block (for example cup/cap behavior or another clean notion if binary terminology is insufficient).
4. Say explicitly which formulas/claims are exact identities and which are only inequalities.
5. Output repo-ready markdown with a `Summary:` line.
   - Suitable slug if successful: `lemmas/ternary-one-split-structure`.
   - If the natural ternary formulation breaks, give a clean obstruction note instead with a suitable slug under `attempts/`.

Requirements:
- Do not analyze the full recursion $T_m$ yet.
- Do not attempt asymptotic counting.
- Do not revisit binary lag variants.
- Keep the task local: one ternary split only.
- The note should be self-contained and make clear why this local classification is the necessary next step before any ternary recurrence can be written.

Summary: In a clean left-middle-right ternary split with the vertical-dual one-split orientation, every convex subset meeting more than one block is classified exactly as follows: for any two-block span, the earlier block contributes a cap and the later block contributes a cup; for a three-block span, the left block is a cap, the right block is a cup, and the middle block contributes at most one upper bridge point and at most one lower bridge point, determined by the endpoint-dependent bridge lines $\lambda r$ and $\ell\rho$. All formulas below are exact identities.

Let
$$
P=L\sqcup M\sqcup R
$$
be a finite planar point set in general position. After a sufficiently small generic rotation, assume all $x$-coordinates are distinct and
$$
x(L)<x(M)<x(R).
$$

We use the following precise ternary separated-position hypothesis.

## Ternary separated position

Assume:

1. every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly above every point of $M\cup R$;
2. every line through two points of $M$ lies strictly below every point of $L$ and strictly above every point of $R$;
3. every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly below every point of $L\cup M$.

Equivalently: for each earlier-later pair of blocks, every secant of the earlier block lies strictly above the later block, and every secant of the later block lies strictly below the earlier block.

For a set $S$ in convex position, write $U(S)$ and $D(S)$ for the upper and lower hull chains, both listed from left to right. A chain is a cup if its consecutive slopes are strictly increasing, and a cap if its consecutive slopes are strictly decreasing.

## Lemma

Let $S\subseteq P$ be in convex position and assume that $S$ meets more than one block.

### 1. Subsets meeting exactly two blocks

If $S$ meets exactly two blocks, say an earlier block $X$ and a later block $Y$, then:

- the points of $S\cap X$ are exactly the $X$-vertices on $U(S)$, hence $S\cap X$ is a cap in $X$;
- the points of $S\cap Y$ are exactly the $Y$-vertices on $D(S)$, hence $S\cap Y$ is a cup in $Y$.

So, exactly:

- for $L\cup M$: the $L$-part is a cap and the $M$-part is a cup;
- for $M\cup R$: the $M$-part is a cap and the $R$-part is a cup;
- for $L\cup R$: the $L$-part is a cap and the $R$-part is a cup.

These are exact structural identities.

### 2. Subsets meeting all three blocks

Assume now
$$
S\cap L\neq\varnothing,\qquad S\cap M\neq\varnothing,\qquad S\cap R\neq\varnothing.
$$
Write
$$
\ell=\min_x S\in L,\qquad r=\max_x S\in R,
$$
$$
\lambda=\max_x(S\cap L),\qquad \rho=\min_x(S\cap R),
$$
and list
$$
S\cap L=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_a=\lambda\},\qquad
S\cap R=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_b=r\}.
$$

Then:

1. $D(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $L$, namely $\ell$.
2. $U(S)$ contains exactly one vertex from $R$, namely $r$.
3. $U(S)$ contains at most one vertex from $M$.
4. $D(S)$ contains at most one vertex from $M$.

Hence
$$
U(S)=v_1,\dots,v_a,\;m^\uparrow,\;r
$$
with $m^\uparrow$ omitted if $U(S)\cap M=\varnothing$, and
$$
D(S)=\ell,\;m^\downarrow,\;u_1,\dots,u_b
$$
with $m^\downarrow$ omitted if $D(S)\cap M=\varnothing$.

Consequently:

- $S\cap L$ is a cap in $L$ with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$;
- $S\cap R$ is a cup in $R$ with endpoints $(\rho,r)$;
- $|S\cap M|\in\{1,2\}$;
- if $|S\cap M|=2$, then one middle point lies on $U(S)$ and one lies on $D(S)$.

So the middle block is not a cup/cap chain. Its exact local type is an upper bridge point together with a lower bridge point, each optional but not both absent.

Define the bridge regions
$$
M^\uparrow(\lambda,r):=\{m\in M:\text{$m$ lies strictly above the line }\lambda r\},
$$
$$
M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho):=\{m\in M:\text{$m$ lies strictly below the line }\ell\rho\}.
$$
Then
$$
m^\uparrow\in M^\uparrow(\lambda,r),\qquad
m^\downarrow\in M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho),
$$
and the two regions are disjoint.

Conversely, let
$$
A=\{v_1=\ell<\cdots<v_a=\lambda\}\subseteq L
$$
be any cap in $L$, and let
$$
B=\{u_1=\rho<\cdots<u_b=r\}\subseteq R
$$
be any cup in $R$. Choose
$$
m^\uparrow\in M^\uparrow(\lambda,r)\cup\{\bot\},\qquad
m^\downarrow\in M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho)\cup\{\bot\},
$$
not both equal to $\bot$. Then
$$
S:=A\cup B\cup\bigl(\{m^\uparrow\}\setminus\{\bot\}\bigr)\cup\bigl(\{m^\downarrow\}\setminus\{\bot\}\bigr)
$$
is in convex position, meets all three blocks, and has hull chains exactly
$$
U(S)=A,\;m^\uparrow,\;r,
\qquad
D(S)=\ell,\;m^\downarrow,\;B.
$$

Thus the three-block classification is exact.

## Proof

The two-block statement is the vertical dual of the binary one-split structure lemma. If an earlier block $X$ and a later block $Y$ are in the present orientation, then $U(S)$ cannot contain two vertices of $Y$, because an upper-hull edge through two points of $Y$ would have to lie above all of $S$, while every point of $X$ lies strictly above every $Y$-secant. Dually, $D(S)$ cannot contain two vertices of $X$, because a lower-hull edge through two points of $X$ would have to lie below all of $S$, while every point of $Y$ lies strictly below every $X$-secant. Hence the earlier block lies on the upper hull and forms a cap, while the later block lies on the lower hull and forms a cup.

Now assume $S$ meets all three blocks.

If $D(S)$ contained two vertices of $L$, then the first two such vertices on $D(S)$ would be consecutive on $D(S)$. Since they form a lower-hull edge, all points of $S$ must lie on or above their line. But every point of $M\cup R$ lies strictly below every $L$-secant, contradiction. So $D(S)$ contains exactly one $L$-vertex, namely $\ell$.

Dually, $U(S)$ contains exactly one $R$-vertex, namely $r$.

If $U(S)$ contained two vertices of $M$, then the last two such vertices on $U(S)$ would be consecutive on $U(S)$, and their line would have to lie above all of $S$. But every point of $L$ lies strictly above every $M$-secant, contradiction. Hence $U(S)$ contains at most one $M$-vertex.

Similarly, if $D(S)$ contained two vertices of $M$, then the first two such vertices on $D(S)$ would be consecutive on $D(S)$, and their line would have to lie below all of $S$. But every point of $R$ lies strictly below every $M$-secant, contradiction. Hence $D(S)$ contains at most one $M$-vertex.

Therefore all points of $S\cap L\setminus\{\ell\}$ lie on $U(S)$, so $S\cap L$ is a cap, and all points of $S\cap R\setminus\{r\}$ lie on $D(S)$, so $S\cap R$ is a cup. This gives the stated hull formulas.

Set
$$
A:=(S\cap L)\cup(S\cap R).
$$
By the already proved $L$-$R$ two-block case, $A$ is in convex position with upper hull
$$
v_1,\dots,v_a,r
$$
and lower hull
$$
\ell,u_1,\dots,u_b.
$$
Since all points of $M$ lie strictly between the $x$-ranges of $L$ and $R$, the portion of $\partial\operatorname{conv}(A)$ across the $M$-strip is exactly the upper segment $\lambda r$ and the lower segment $\ell\rho$.

Every point of $S\cap M$ is a vertex of $\operatorname{conv}(S)$, hence lies outside $\operatorname{conv}(A)$. So each middle point lies either strictly above $\lambda r$ or strictly below $\ell\rho$. This proves
$$
S\cap M\subseteq M^\uparrow(\lambda,r)\cup M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho).
$$
The two regions are disjoint because $\lambda r$ is the upper boundary and $\ell\rho$ is the lower boundary of $\operatorname{conv}(A)$ across the $M$-strip. Together with the already proved at-most-one-on-each-hull statement, this yields $|S\cap M|\in\{1,2\}$ and the exact upper/lower placement.

For the converse, start from the $L$-$R$ convex set
$$
S_0:=A\cup B.
$$
Its upper hull is $A,r$, and its lower hull is $\ell,B$.

If $m^\uparrow\in M^\uparrow(\lambda,r)$, then $\lambda,m^\uparrow,r$ is a $3$-cap. Indeed, if $a=1$, this is exactly the condition that $m^\uparrow$ lie above $\ell r$. If $a\ge2$, then the last edge of the cap $A$ has slope $\operatorname{slope}(v_{a-1},v_a)$, every point of $M$ lies strictly below the line $v_{a-1}v_a$, so
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_{a-1},v_a)>\operatorname{slope}(v_a,m^\uparrow),
$$
and $m^\uparrow$ above the line $\lambda r$ gives
$$
\operatorname{slope}(v_a,m^\uparrow)>\operatorname{slope}(m^\uparrow,r).
$$
Hence $A,m^\uparrow,r$ is a cap.

Dually, if $m^\downarrow\in M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho)$, then $\ell,m^\downarrow,B$ is a cup.

So the chosen upper chain is a cap from $\ell$ to $r$, and the chosen lower chain is a cup from $\ell$ to $r$. Therefore all interior vertices of the upper chain lie strictly above the chord $\ell r$, and all interior vertices of the lower chain lie strictly below $\ell r$. The two chains meet only at $\ell$ and $r$, hence form the boundary of a convex polygon whose vertex set is exactly $S$.

This proves the converse. $\square$

## Exact fixed-state formulas

Define
$$
\widetilde Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda):=
\begin{cases}
1,& a=1\text{ and }\ell=\lambda,\\
Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda),& a\ge2\text{ and }\ell<\lambda,\\
0,&\text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
$$
and
$$
\widetilde Q_+(b,R;\rho,r):=
\begin{cases}
1,& b=1\text{ and }\rho=r,\\
Q_+(b,R;\rho,r),& b\ge2\text{ and }\rho<r,\\
0,&\text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$
Also set
$$
U_M(\lambda,r):=\bigl|M^\uparrow(\lambda,r)\bigr|,
\qquad
D_M(\ell,\rho):=\bigl|M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho)\bigr|.
$$

### Two-block identities

For each earlier-later pair $(X,Y)\in\{(L,M),(M,R),(L,R)\}$, the endpoint-refined two-block count is exactly
$$
\text{(cap count on $X$)}\times \text{(cup count on $Y$)}.
$$
This is an exact identity.

### Three-block identities

Let
$$
C^{LMR}(a,c,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
$$
denote the number of convex subsets $S\subseteq P$ with
$$
|S\cap L|=a,\qquad |S\cap M|=c,\qquad |S\cap R|=b,
$$
meeting all three blocks and having outer state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

Then:
$$
C^{LMR}(a,1,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,
\widetilde Q_+(b,R;\rho,r)\,
\bigl(U_M(\lambda,r)+D_M(\ell,\rho)\bigr),
$$
$$
C^{LMR}(a,2,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_-(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,
\widetilde Q_+(b,R;\rho,r)\,
U_M(\lambda,r)\,D_M(\ell,\rho),
$$
and for every $c\ge3$,
$$
C^{LMR}(a,c,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)=0.
$$

These are exact identities, not inequalities.

## Why this is the necessary local step before any ternary recurrence

In the binary split, fixed-state convex subsets factor through two local chain states. In the ternary split, they do not: after fixing the outer cap state $(\ell,\lambda)$ on $L$ and the outer cup state $(\rho,r)$ on $R$, the middle contribution still depends on the endpoint-dependent bridge regions
$$
M^\uparrow(\lambda,r),\qquad M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho).
$$
So any exact ternary recurrence must carry this new bridge data. One cannot write an exact ternary recurrence using only aggregate cup/cap counts on the three blocks.

This note isolates that new local state exactly, without yet attempting any full ternary recursion or any asymptotic counting.

# Your Task

Independently verify the worker's output above. Do not verify formal Lean code - focus on informal reasoning, logical correctness, and whether the task was completed as requested.

======== RESPONSE ========

No mathematical flaw stands out in the worker’s note, provided the theorem is read under the worker’s explicit separated-position hypothesis, not a weaker informal variant.

- The forward classification is sound. The secant-separation assumptions force any two-block convex subset to place the earlier block on $U(S)$ as a cap and the later block on $D(S)$ as a cup. In the three-block case, the same consecutive-edge contradiction shows $D(S)$ has exactly one $L$-vertex, $U(S)$ exactly one $R$-vertex, and $M$ contributes at most one vertex to each hull.
- The bridge-line description is also correct. After fixing $A=(S\cap L)\cup(S\cap R)$, the part of $\partial\operatorname{conv}(A)$ over the middle strip is exactly the upper edge $\lambda r$ and lower edge $\ell\rho$, so every middle vertex must lie in $M^\uparrow(\lambda,r)\cup M^\downarrow(\ell,\rho)$. Conversely, any optional choice of $m^\uparrow$ above $\lambda r$ and/or $m^\downarrow$ below $\ell\rho$ gives an upper cap chain and lower cup chain, hence a convex polygon. That makes the stated $c=1,2$ formulas exact, and $c\ge 3$ impossible.
- The only thing I would call out is editorial: $Q_\pm$ are used without being locally defined, so strict self-containedness would benefit from one sentence defining them as endpoint-refined cap/cup counts. That is not a mathematical defect.
