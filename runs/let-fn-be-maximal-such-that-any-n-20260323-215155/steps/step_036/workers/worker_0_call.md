# Task

Use [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]], [[status/endpoint-matched-recursive-family]], and [[attempts/alternative-construction-fibonacci-split]].

Work on exactly one task: analyze the fixed-lag separated recursion
$$
F_m^{(t)}=F_{m-1}^{(t)}\sqcup F_{m-t}^{(t)}
$$
for a fixed integer parameter $t\ge 2$, treated symbolically as one family, and decide whether increasing the lag can ever plausibly lower the $(\log n)^2$ coefficient below $1$.

Deliverable:
1. Define the family precisely, including a clean choice of base cases and the growth law for
   $$
   N_m^{(t)}:=|F_m^{(t)}|.
   $$
2. Derive the first exact recurrences for cup counts, cap counts, and convex-subset counts analogous to the Fibonacci note.
3. Extract one explicit top-split obstruction term strong enough to give an asymptotic lower bound on
   $$
   g(F_m^{(t)})
   $$
   as a function of $t$.
4. Decide one of:
   - the whole fixed-lag family is obstructed (for all fixed $t\ge 2$, or at least for a clearly stated range),
   - the analysis reveals a real downward trend worth pursuing,
   - or there is a specific unresolved step that blocks a conclusion.
5. Output repo-ready markdown with a `Summary:` line.
   - If conclusive, suitable slug: `status/fixed-lag-separated-recursions-obstruction`.
   - If not fully conclusive, suitable slug: `attempts/fixed-lag-separated-recursions`.

Requirements:
- Treat this as one family/class, not a survey of unrelated constructions.
- Be explicit about which displayed formulas are exact identities and which are inequalities.
- Do not revisit endpoint refinements inside the balanced family.
- Do not use literature or Lean.
- If you cannot settle all fixed $t$, isolate the exact first place where the symbolic-$t$ analysis stops, rather than overstating.

## [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]]

Summary: Verified upper bound via a recursively separated family showing $f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}$.

Let $P_1$ be a two-point set, and for $m\ge 2$ let
$$
P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m
$$
where $L_m$ and $R_m$ are affine copies of $P_{m-1}$ in the standard recursively separated position. Thus
$$
|P_m|=2^m \qquad (m\ge 1).
$$

For each fixed $m$, we may first apply a sufficiently small generic rotation to $P_m$ so that all points of $P_m$ have distinct $x$-coordinates. This does not change the order type, hence does not change which subsets are in convex position. After this normalization, for $r\ge 2$ let $Q_+(r,P_m)$ and $Q_-(r,P_m)$ denote respectively the numbers of $r$-cups and $r$-caps in $P_m$. For $k\ge 1$, let $C_k(P_m)$ be the number of $k$-point subsets of $P_m$ in convex position, and set
$$
g(P_m):=\sum_{k=1}^{2^m} C_k(P_m).
$$

We first record the cup/cap bound.

**Lemma.** For each $r\ge 2$ there is a constant $d_r>0$ such that
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le d_r\,2^{rm}\qquad\text{for all }m\ge 1.
$$

**Proof.** The base case $r=2$ is explicit:
$$
Q_+(2,P_m)=Q_-(2,P_m)=\binom{2^m}{2}\le 2^{2m},
$$
so we may take $d_2=1$.

Now fix $r\ge 3$ and assume $d_{r-1}$ has already been chosen. For $m=1$ we have $Q_\pm(r,P_1)=0$, since $|P_1|=2<r$. For $m\ge 2$, every $r$-cup in $P_m$ is either contained entirely in $L_m$ or entirely in $R_m$, or else consists of one point from one side together with an $(r-1)$-cup from the other side; the same dichotomy holds for $r$-caps. Hence
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le 2\,Q_\pm(r,P_{m-1})+2^{m-1}Q_\pm(r-1,P_{m-1}).
$$
Choose $d_r$ so that
$$
(2^r-2)d_r\ge d_{r-1}.
$$
Then, using the inductive bounds in $m$ and in $r$,
\[
\begin{aligned}
Q_\pm(r,P_m)
&\le 2d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}+2^{m-1}d_{r-1}\,2^{(r-1)(m-1)} \\
&= \bigl(2d_r+d_{r-1}\bigr)2^{r(m-1)}
 \le 2^r d_r\,2^{r(m-1)}
 = d_r\,2^{rm}.
\end{aligned}
\]
This proves the claim. $\square$

Now let $k\ge 2$. Every convex $k$-subset $S\subseteq P_m$ has a unique leftmost point and a unique rightmost point. Along the upper hull from left to right one obtains an $a$-cup for some $2\le a\le k$, and along the lower hull one obtains a $(k+2-a)$-cap. Forgetting the endpoint-matching condition gives an injection into the disjoint union of pairs of chains, so
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m).
$$
This is the accepted chain-pair injection.

Combining this with the accepted cup/cap estimates gives the finite-level bound
$$
C_k(P_m)\le (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}
\qquad (k\ge 2).
$$
For $k=1$ we simply have
$$
C_1(P_m)=|P_m|=2^m.
$$

Therefore
$$
g(P_m)=C_1(P_m)+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} C_k(P_m)
\le 2^m+\sum_{k=2}^{2^m} (k-1)\,2^{(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor}.
$$
The exponent
$$
\phi_m(k):=(k+2)m-\lfloor (k+1)^2/4\rfloor
$$
is maximized for $k$ near $2m-1$, with maximum value $m^2+m+O(1)$, and it decreases quadratically away from that point. Hence the whole sum is bounded by a polynomial factor times $2^{m^2+m}$, and therefore
$$
g(P_m)\le 2^{m^2+m+O(\log m)}.
$$

Finally, extend from the special sizes $|P_m|=2^m$ to arbitrary $n\ge 1$. If $n=1$, then trivially $f(1)=1$. If $n\ge 2$, let
$$
M:=\lceil \log_2 n\rceil,
$$
so $M\ge 1$ and $|P_M|=2^M\ge n$. Choose any $n$-point subset $S\subseteq P_M$. Every convex subset of $S$ is also a convex subset of $P_M$, so
$$
g(S)\le g(P_M)\le 2^{M^2+M+O(\log M)}.
$$
Since $M=\log_2 n+O(1)$, this yields
$$
f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}
\qquad (n\ge 1).
$$

As for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim: the obstruction is exactly that total cup/cap counts do not by themselves control convex $k$-sets, because a convex $k$-set requires the upper and lower hull chains to have matching endpoints, while the aggregate quantities $Q_+$ and $Q_-$ forget that endpoint data.

Remaining proof-tightness issues: none seen in this corrected upper-bound note beyond the already-recorded endpoint-matching obstruction for the discarded $\alpha=2$ claim.

## [[status/endpoint-matched-recursive-family]]

Summary: After summing the exact fixed-endpoint identity over the actual endpoint pairs of a given first-separation scale, the endpoint-matched count factorizes exactly as
$$
\sum_{s(\ell,r)=s} E_k(\ell,r)
=
2^{m-s}\sum_{a=1}^{k-1} Q_+(a,P_{s-1})\,Q_-(k-a,P_{s-1}).
$$
So the worst-case-over-pairs step can be repaired completely inside the recursive family. However, the repaired aggregate is already of size $2^{m^2-O(m)}$ for the top split and $k=2m$, hence the endpoint-matched analysis still has leading coefficient $1$ at the $(\log_2 n)^2$ scale and gives no genuine improvement.

Let
$$
P_m=L_m\sqcup R_m
$$
be the standard recursively separated family from [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]]. For $d\ge 1$ and $a\ge 1$, set
$$
Q_d(a):=Q_+(a,P_d)=Q_-(a,P_d).
$$
The equality is by the left-right symmetry of the construction.

For $\ell<r$ in $P_m$, let $s(\ell,r)$ be the first separation scale, so $(\ell,r)$ lies in a unique copy of $P_s$ whose left and right children contain $\ell$ and $r$. Let $\ell^-,r^+\in P_{s-1}$ be the corresponding points in those child copies. By [[attempts/endpoint-matched-recursive-family-worst-case-gap]], for every such pair,
$$
E_k(\ell,r)=\sum_{a=1}^{k-1} U_{s-1}(a;\ell^-)\,V_{s-1}(k-a;r^+).
$$
This is an exact identity.

## Exact Aggregate Over Actual Endpoint Pairs

Fix $m\ge s\ge 2$, and define
$$
R_{m,s}(k):=\sum_{s(\ell,r)=s} E_k(\ell,r).
$$
There are exactly $2^{m-s}$ copies of $P_s$ inside $P_m$. In each such copy, the actual pairs $(\ell,r)$ with first separation scale $s$ are in bijection with the actual pairs $(x,y)\in P_{s-1}\times P_{s-1}$ coming from the left and right children. Therefore
$$
\begin{aligned}
R_{m,s}(k)
&=2^{m-s}\sum_{x\in P_{s-1}}\sum_{y\in P_{s-1}}
\sum_{a=1}^{k-1} U_{s-1}(a;x)\,V_{s-1}(k-a;y) \\
&=2^{m-s}\sum_{a=1}^{k-1}
\left(\sum_{x\in P_{s-1}} U_{s-1}(a;x)\right)
\left(\sum_{y\in P_{s-1}} V_{s-1}(k-a;y)\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
This is still exact: it is the sum over the true endpoint pairs, with no worst-case bound.

Now
$$
\sum_{x\in P_d} U_d(a;x)=Q_+(a,P_d)=Q_d(a),
\qquad
\sum_{y\in P_d} V_d(a;y)=Q_-(a,P_d)=Q_d(a),
$$
because every $a$-cup has a unique left endpoint and every $a$-cap has a unique right endpoint. Hence
$$
R_{m,s}(k)
=
2^{m-s}\sum_{a=1}^{k-1} Q_{s-1}(a)\,Q_{s-1}(k-a).
$$
This is the exact aggregate endpoint-matched formula.

Equivalently, if
$$
A_d(z):=\sum_{a\ge 1} Q_d(a)\,z^{a-1},
$$
then
$$
R_{m,s}(k)=2^{m-s}[z^{k-2}]\,A_{s-1}(z)^2.
$$
Again this is exact.

## Exact Recurrence For Convex Subsets

For $k\ge 2$, decomposing a convex $k$-subset of $P_m$ according to whether it lies in one child copy or spans the top split gives
$$
C_k(P_m)=2\,C_k(P_{m-1})+\sum_{a=1}^{k-1} Q_{m-1}(a)\,Q_{m-1}(k-a).
$$
This is an exact identity, not an inequality. Thus exact endpoint aggregation produces exactly the cup/cap convolution already present at each recursive split.

## Exact Formula For The Cup/Cap Totals

Summing the exact one-sided recurrences from [[attempts/endpoint-matched-recursive-family-worst-case-gap]] over all endpoints gives, for $d\ge 2$ and $a\ge 2$,
$$
Q_d(a)=2\,Q_{d-1}(a)+2^{d-1}Q_{d-1}(a-1),
$$
with
$$
Q_d(1)=2^d.
$$
Equivalently,
$$
A_1(z)=2+z,
\qquad
A_d(z)=(2+2^{d-1}z)\,A_{d-1}(z),
$$
so
$$
A_d(z)=\prod_{j=0}^{d-1}(2+2^j z).
$$
This is exact.

Extracting coefficients,
$$
Q_d(a)=\sum_{\substack{J\subseteq\{0,\dots,d-1\}\\|J|=a-1}}
2^{\,d-a+1+\sum_{j\in J} j}.
$$
This is exact. Hence
$$
Q_d(a)\ge 2^{\,ad-\frac{a(a+1)}2+1},
$$
by taking the largest summand, and
$$
Q_d(a)\le \binom{d}{a-1}\,2^{\,ad-\frac{a(a+1)}2+1}
\le 2^{\,ad-\frac{a(a+1)}2+1+d}.
$$
These are inequalities.

## Obstruction At The Quadratic Scale

The exact aggregate already has a top-split term of size $2^{m^2-O(m)}$.

Indeed, $A_d(z)$ has degree $d$, and its top coefficient is
$$
Q_d(d+1)=2^{0+1+\cdots+(d-1)}=2^{\binom d2}.
$$
This is exact.

Now take the top split of $P_m$, so $s=m$ and $d=m-1$. For $k=2m$, the convolution has only one nonzero term, namely $a=m$, because $Q_{m-1}(a)=0$ for $a>m$. Therefore
$$
R_{m,m}(2m)=Q_{m-1}(m)^2
=2^{\,2\binom{m-1}{2}}
=2^{(m-1)(m-2)}.
$$
This is exact.

So the repaired aggregate endpoint-matched count already contains terms of size
$$
2^{m^2-3m+2}=2^{(\log_2 |P_m|)^2+O(\log |P_m|)}.
$$
Therefore exact summation over the actual endpoint states/signatures does not improve the quadratic coefficient below $1$.

Combined with the accepted upper bound from [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]],
$$
g(P_m)\le 2^{m^2+O(m)},
$$
the endpoint-matched analysis inside the present recursive family still has leading coefficient exactly $1$ at the $(\log_2 n)^2$ scale.

Conclusion: the gap in [[attempts/endpoint-matched-recursive-family-worst-case-gap]] can be repaired rigorously, but the repaired aggregate shows no real improvement. Endpoint matching disappears only after an exact summation over the actual endpoint pairs, and that exact sum is already large enough to force the same quadratic coefficient $1$.

## [[attempts/alternative-construction-fibonacci-split]]

Summary: Replacing the balanced split by the non-self-similar separated recursion $F_m=F_{m-1}\sqcup F_{m-2}$ gives exact recurrences different from the balanced family, but one explicit top-split term already forces
$$
g(F_m)\ge 2^{\left(\frac{3}{4\log_2\varphi}+o(1)\right)(\log_2 n)^2},
$$
with $\frac{3}{4\log_2\varphi}>1$, so this family should be discarded as a route to lowering the coefficient $1$.

After [[status/endpoint-matched-recursive-family]], the next natural fork is to change the recursion itself rather than further refine endpoint bookkeeping. A minimal explicit test is the unbalanced separated split with child depths $m-1$ and $m-2$.

## Definition

Let $F_1$ be a one-point set and $F_2$ a two-point set. For $m\ge 3$, define
$$
F_m=L_m\sqcup R_m,
$$
where $L_m$ is an affine copy of $F_{m-1}$, $R_m$ an affine copy of $F_{m-2}$, and $(L_m,R_m)$ is in the standard one-split separated position.

Let
$$
N_m:=|F_m|.
$$
Then exactly
$$
N_1=1,\qquad N_2=2,\qquad N_m=N_{m-1}+N_{m-2}\quad (m\ge 3).
$$
Hence $N_m=\Theta(\varphi^m)$ with $\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$, so
$$
\log_2 N_m=m\log_2\varphi+O(1).
$$

For $a\ge 1$ define
$$
U_m(a):=Q_+(a,F_m),\qquad V_m(a):=Q_-(a,F_m),
$$
and for $k\ge 1$ define
$$
C_m(k):=C_k(F_m).
$$

## Exact Recurrences

By the exact one-split factorization recorded in [[status/recursive-family-information-loss]], for $a\ge 2$,
$$
U_m(a)=U_{m-1}(a)+U_{m-2}(a)+N_{m-2}U_{m-1}(a-1).
$$
This is an exact identity: an $a$-cup is either contained in the left child, contained in the right child, or spanning; in the spanning case it consists of an $(a-1)$-cup in $L_m$ together with one point of $R_m$. Also
$$
U_m(1)=N_m.
$$

Dually,
$$
V_m(a)=V_{m-1}(a)+V_{m-2}(a)+N_{m-1}V_{m-2}(a-1),
$$
again an exact identity, with
$$
V_m(1)=N_m.
$$

Summing the exact endpoint-refined spanning identity over all states gives the exact convex-subset recurrence
$$
C_m(k)=C_{m-1}(k)+C_{m-2}(k)+\sum_{a=1}^{k-1}U_{m-1}(a)V_{m-2}(k-a).
$$

Thus this family does give a genuinely different recurrence from the balanced family: the spanning term mixes different depths.

## First Top-Scale Obstruction

Let
$$
\nu_m:=\max\{a:U_m(a)>0\}.
$$
From the exact cup recurrence,
$$
\nu_1=1,\qquad \nu_2=2,\qquad \nu_m=\nu_{m-1}+1,
$$
so exactly
$$
\nu_m=m.
$$

Let
$$
U_m^*:=U_m(m).
$$
Since neither child alone contains an $m$-cup, the maximal cups are exactly the spanning ones, hence
$$
U_m^*=N_{m-2}U_{m-1}^*
$$
with $U_2^*=1$. Therefore exactly
$$
U_m^*=\prod_{j=1}^{m-2}N_j.
$$

Now set
$$
v_m:=\max\{a:V_m(a)>0\}.
$$
From the exact cap recurrence,
$$
v_1=1,\qquad v_2=2,\qquad v_m=\max(v_{m-1},1+v_{m-2}),
$$
so
$$
v_{2t}=t+1,\qquad v_{2t+1}=t+1.
$$

Define
$$
V_{2t}^*:=V_{2t}(t+1).
$$
Because $v_{2t}=t+1>v_{2t-1}=t$ and $v_{2t-2}=t$, the maximal caps in even depth are again exactly the spanning ones. Thus
$$
V_{2t}^*=N_{2t-1}V_{2t-2}^*
$$
with $V_2^*=1$, hence exactly
$$
V_{2t}^*=\prod_{i=1}^{t-1}N_{2i+1}.
$$

Take $m=2t+2$. In the exact convex-subset recurrence, keep only the summand
$$
a=\nu_{m-1}=2t+1,\qquad k-a=v_{m-2}=t+1.
$$
Then
$$
C_m(3t+2)\ge U_{2t+1}^* V_{2t}^*
=\left(\prod_{j=1}^{2t-1}N_j\right)\left(\prod_{i=1}^{t-1}N_{2i+1}\right).
$$
This is an inequality obtained from one term of an exact recurrence.

Using $N_r=\Theta(\varphi^r)$,
$$
\log_2 U_{2t+1}^*
=(\log_2\varphi)\sum_{j=1}^{2t-1}j+O(t)
=(\log_2\varphi)(2t^2-t)+O(t),
$$
and
$$
\log_2 V_{2t}^*
=(\log_2\varphi)\sum_{i=1}^{t-1}(2i+1)+O(t)
=(\log_2\varphi)(t^2-1)+O(t).
$$
Therefore
$$
\log_2 g(F_m)\ge \log_2 C_m(3t+2)\ge \frac34(\log_2\varphi)m^2+O(m).
$$

Since $\log_2 N_m=m\log_2\varphi+O(1)$, this becomes
$$
g(F_m)\ge 2^{\left(\frac{3}{4\log_2\varphi}+o(1)\right)(\log_2 N_m)^2}.
$$
Numerically,
$$
\frac{3}{4\log_2\varphi}\approx 1.0802>1.
$$

## Conclusion

This Fibonacci-split family is well-posed and its counting recurrence is genuinely different from the balanced family, but it already fails at the quadratic scale: one explicit top-split contribution forces a coefficient strictly larger than $1$. So this alternative should be discarded as a route to improving [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].

# Fixed-Lag Separated Recursions: Obstruction

Summary: For the fixed-lag separated recursion
$$
F_m^{(t)}=F_{m-1}^{(t)}\sqcup F_{m-t}^{(t)} \qquad (t\ge 2),
$$
one explicit top-split term already gives
$$
\limsup_{m\to\infty}\frac{\log_2 g(F_m^{(t)})}{(\log_2 |F_m^{(t)}|)^2}\ge \alpha_t,
\qquad
\alpha_t=\frac{t+1}{2t\log_2\lambda_t},
$$
where $\lambda_t>1$ is the positive root of $\lambda_t^t=\lambda_t^{t-1}+1$. Moreover $\alpha_t>1$ for every fixed $t\ge 2$. Hence no fixed lag can lower the quadratic coefficient below $1$; the whole fixed-lag family is obstructed.

Fix $t\ge 2$ once and for all.

## Definition

Define $F_1^{(t)},\dots,F_t^{(t)}$ to be one-point sets. For $m\ge t+1$, define
$$
F_m^{(t)}=L_m\sqcup R_m,
$$
where $L_m$ is an affine copy of $F_{m-1}^{(t)}$, $R_m$ is an affine copy of $F_{m-t}^{(t)}$, and $(L_m,R_m)$ is in the standard separated position.

Let
$$
N_m:=|F_m^{(t)}|.
$$
Then the size sequence satisfies the exact identities
$$
N_1=\cdots=N_t=1,
\qquad
N_m=N_{m-1}+N_{m-t}\quad (m\ge t+1).
$$
Let $\lambda_t>1$ be the unique positive root of
$$
p_t(x):=x^t-x^{t-1}-1.
$$
Then standard linear-recurrence theory gives
$$
N_m=\Theta_t(\lambda_t^m),
\qquad
\log_2 N_m=m\log_2\lambda_t+O_t(1).
$$

For $a\ge 1$ define
$$
U_m(a):=Q_+(a,F_m^{(t)}),
\qquad
V_m(a):=Q_-(a,F_m^{(t)}),
$$
and for $k\ge 1$ define
$$
C_m(k):=C_k(F_m^{(t)}).
$$

## Exact Recurrences

For $a\ge 2$ and $m\ge t+1$, the cup counts satisfy the exact identity
$$
U_m(a)=U_{m-1}(a)+U_{m-t}(a)+N_{m-t}\,U_{m-1}(a-1),
$$
with
$$
U_m(1)=N_m.
$$

For $a\ge 2$ and $m\ge t+1$, the cap counts satisfy the exact identity
$$
V_m(a)=V_{m-1}(a)+V_{m-t}(a)+N_{m-1}\,V_{m-t}(a-1),
$$
with
$$
V_m(1)=N_m.
$$

For $k\ge 1$ and $m\ge t+1$, the convex-subset counts satisfy the exact identity
$$
C_m(k)=C_{m-1}(k)+C_{m-t}(k)+\sum_{a=1}^{k-1}U_{m-1}(a)V_{m-t}(k-a).
$$

These are the exact analogues of the Fibonacci-split recurrences.

## Maximal Cups

Let
$$
\nu_m:=\max\{a:U_m(a)>0\}.
$$
Then
$$
\nu_1=\cdots=\nu_t=1,
\qquad
\nu_m=\nu_{m-1}+1 \quad (m\ge t+1),
$$
because the spanning term adds one point to a maximal cup in the left child, while $\nu_{m-1}\ge \nu_{m-t}$. Hence exactly
$$
\nu_m=
\begin{cases}
1,&1\le m\le t,\\
m-t+1,&m\ge t.
\end{cases}
$$

Set
$$
U_m^*:=U_m(\nu_m).
$$
For $m\ge t+1$, the maximal cups are exactly the spanning ones, so
$$
U_m^*=N_{m-t}\,U_{m-1}^*
$$
is an exact identity. Since $U_t^*=1$, it follows exactly that
$$
U_m^*=\prod_{j=1}^{m-t}N_j
\qquad (m\ge t).
$$

## Maximal Caps

Let
$$
v_m:=\max\{a:V_m(a)>0\}.
$$
Then
$$
v_1=\cdots=v_t=1,
\qquad
v_m=\max\bigl(v_{m-1},\,1+v_{m-t}\bigr)\quad (m\ge t+1),
$$
so by induction
$$
v_m=1+\left\lfloor\frac{m-1}{t}\right\rfloor
$$
exactly.

The maximal cap length increases only at depths $m=qt+1$. Define
$$
W_q:=V_{qt+1}(q+1)\qquad (q\ge 0).
$$
Since
$$
v_{qt}=q,
\qquad
v_{(q-1)t+1}=q,
\qquad
v_{qt+1}=q+1,
$$
the maximal caps at depth $qt+1$ are exactly the spanning ones, hence
$$
W_q=N_{qt}\,W_{q-1}
$$
is an exact identity for $q\ge 1$, with $W_0=1$. Therefore exactly
$$
W_q=\prod_{i=1}^q N_{it}.
$$

## Explicit Top-Split Obstruction

Take
$$
m_q:=(q+1)t+1.
$$
Then
$$
m_q-1=(q+1)t,
\qquad
m_q-t=qt+1.
$$
In the exact convex-subset recurrence for $C_{m_q}(k)$, keep only the single term
$$
a=\nu_{m_q-1}=\nu_{(q+1)t}=qt+1,
\qquad
k-a=v_{m_q-t}=v_{qt+1}=q+1.
$$
This gives the inequality
$$
C_{m_q}\bigl(q(t+1)+2\bigr)
\ge
U_{(q+1)t}^*\,W_q
=
\left(\prod_{j=1}^{qt}N_j\right)\left(\prod_{i=1}^q N_{it}\right).
$$

Using $N_r=\Theta_t(\lambda_t^r)$, we obtain
$$
\log_2 U_{(q+1)t}^*
=(\log_2\lambda_t)\sum_{j=1}^{qt}j+O_t(q),
$$
and
$$
\log_2 W_q
=(\log_2\lambda_t)\sum_{i=1}^q it+O_t(q).
$$
Therefore
$$
\log_2 g(F_{m_q}^{(t)})
\ge
(\log_2\lambda_t)\left(\sum_{j=1}^{qt}j+\sum_{i=1}^q it\right)+O_t(q).
$$
Since
$$
\sum_{j=1}^{qt}j+\sum_{i=1}^q it
=
\frac{qt(qt+1)}2+\frac{tq(q+1)}2
=
\frac{t(t+1)}2\,q^2+O_t(q),
$$
and
$$
m_q=tq+O_t(1),
$$
this becomes
$$
\log_2 g(F_{m_q}^{(t)})
\ge
\left(\frac{t+1}{2t}\log_2\lambda_t\right)m_q^2+O_t(m_q).
$$
Using
$$
\log_2 N_{m_q}=m_q\log_2\lambda_t+O_t(1),
$$
we get
$$
g(F_{m_q}^{(t)})
\ge
2^{\left(\alpha_t+o(1)\right)(\log_2 N_{m_q})^2},
\qquad
\alpha_t:=\frac{t+1}{2t\log_2\lambda_t}.
$$
Thus
$$
\limsup_{m\to\infty}\frac{\log_2 g(F_m^{(t)})}{(\log_2 N_m)^2}\ge \alpha_t.
$$

## Why $\alpha_t>1$ For Every Fixed $t\ge 2$

It is enough to show
$$
\log_2\lambda_t<\frac{t+1}{2t}.
$$

For $t=2$, $\lambda_2=\varphi=\frac{1+\sqrt5}{2}$. Since
$$
\varphi^4=(\varphi^2)^2=(\varphi+1)^2=3\varphi+2<8,
$$
we have $\log_2\varphi<\frac34$, hence
$$
\alpha_2=\frac{3}{4\log_2\varphi}>1.
$$

For $t=3$,
$$
p_3\!\left(\frac32\right)=\left(\frac32\right)^3-\left(\frac32\right)^2-1=\frac18>0,
$$
so $\lambda_3<\frac32$. Also
$$
\left(\frac32\right)^3=\frac{27}{8}<4=2^2,
$$
so $\log_2(3/2)<\frac23$, hence
$$
\alpha_3=\frac{4}{6\log_2\lambda_3}>1.
$$

For every $t\ge 4$,
$$
p_t(\sqrt2)=2^{(t-1)/2}(\sqrt2-1)-1
\ge 2^{3/2}(\sqrt2-1)-1
=3-2\sqrt2>0.
$$
Therefore $\lambda_t<\sqrt2$, so $\log_2\lambda_t<\frac12$. Hence
$$
\alpha_t=\frac{t+1}{2t\log_2\lambda_t}
>
\frac{t+1}{2t\cdot (1/2)}
=
\frac{t+1}{t}
>1.
$$

So the explicit top-split term already forces a quadratic coefficient strictly larger than $1$ for every fixed lag $t\ge 2$.

## Conclusion

The whole fixed-lag family is obstructed. For every fixed $t\ge 2$, the separated recursion
$$
F_m^{(t)}=F_{m-1}^{(t)}\sqcup F_{m-t}^{(t)}
$$
has an explicit top-split contribution giving
$$
\limsup_{m\to\infty}\frac{\log_2 g(F_m^{(t)})}{(\log_2 |F_m^{(t)}|)^2}\ge \alpha_t>1.
$$
Therefore increasing the lag does not plausibly lower the $(\log n)^2$ coefficient below $1$ inside this class. Endpoint refinements are irrelevant here: the obstruction already appears in one exact top-split term.
