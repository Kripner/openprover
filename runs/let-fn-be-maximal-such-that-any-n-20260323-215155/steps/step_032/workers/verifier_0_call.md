# Original Task

Use [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]], [[lemmas/one-split-crossing-cup-cap-identities]], [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]], and [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]].

Work on exactly one task: produce the final repo-ready note for `status/recursive-family-information-loss` now that the one-split convention has been repaired.

Deliverable:
- Write a short polished markdown item with a `Summary:` line.
- State the exact fixed-state identity and the exact fixed-split-size identity.
- Explicitly derive the exact crossing passage from the corrected convention:
  - the spanning-cup identity obtained from the $b=1$ specialization;
  - the spanning-cap identity obtained from the $a=1$ specialization;
  - explain why these are exact sums over the remaining endpoint parameter, with no inequality.
- Then identify the first inequality in [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]] that actually forgets matched outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$.
- Distinguish that endpoint-forgetting step from earlier auxiliary inequalities used only to bound total cup/cap counts.
- State briefly whether restoring endpoint matching alone would explain or improve the exponent constant $1$, and why.

Requirements:
- Be fully self-contained relative to the cited items.
- Be explicit about which displayed formulas are exact identities and which are inequalities.
- Do not do new asymptotic optimization, literature, Lean, or any new proof strategy beyond this diagnosis.
- Output should be ready for direct storage as `status/recursive-family-information-loss`.


# Worker Output

I could not write the file in this environment because every filesystem/tool call failed with `bwrap: Unknown option --argv0`. The repo-ready content is below.

```markdown
Summary: With the repaired one-split convention, the spanning recurrence is exactly a left-cup/right-cap factorization, and the crossing cup/cap formulas are exact endpoint-refined identities. The first place [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]] truly loses the matched outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$ is the chain-pair inequality
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m),
$$
not the earlier auxiliary inequalities used only to bound total cup/cap counts.

Assume the one-split hypotheses of [[lemmas/one-split-structure-spanning-convex-subsets]]:
$$
P=L\sqcup R,
$$
every point of $L$ lies to the left of every point of $R$, every line through two points of $L$ lies strictly below every point of $R$, and every line through two points of $R$ lies strictly above every point of $L$.

For a spanning convex subset $S\subseteq P$, write
$$
\ell=\min_x S,\qquad r=\max_x S,\qquad \lambda=\max_x(S\cap L),\qquad \rho=\min_x(S\cap R).
$$
For $a,b\ge 1$, let
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
$$
denote the number of spanning convex subsets with $|S\cap L|=a$, $|S\cap R|=b$, and state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$.

The exact fixed-state identity from [[lemmas/one-split-fixed-state-recurrence]] is
$$
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r).
$$
This is an identity, not an inequality: fixing the state fixes the left endpoint pair $(\ell,\lambda)$ and the right endpoint pair $(\rho,r)$ exactly.

If $C^\times(a,b,P)$ denotes the number of spanning convex subsets with $|S\cap L|=a$ and $|S\cap R|=b$, then the exact fixed-split-size identity is
$$
C^\times(a,b,P)
=
\sum_{(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)\,\mathrm{admissible}}
C^\times(a,b,P;\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)
=
\sum_{(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)\,\mathrm{admissible}}
\widetilde Q_+(a,L;\ell,\lambda)\,\widetilde Q_-(b,R;\rho,r).
$$
Again this is an identity: every spanning convex subset has a unique state, so the state classes are disjoint and exhaustive.

Now fix outer endpoints $\ell\in L$ and $r\in R$.

For $t\ge 2$, specialize to $b=1$. Since
$$
\widetilde Q_-(1,R;\rho,r)=0 \text{ unless } \rho=r,\qquad \widetilde Q_-(1,R;r,r)=1,
$$
the fixed-state identity becomes
$$
C^\times(t,1,P;\ell,\lambda,r,r)=Q_+(t,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$
Summing over the remaining endpoint parameter $\lambda$ gives the exact spanning-cup identity
$$
Q_+^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)
=
\sum_{\lambda\in L,\ \ell<\lambda} Q_+(t,L;\ell,\lambda).
$$
There is no inequality here: a spanning $(t+1)$-cup with outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$ has exactly one right-side point, namely $r$, hence a unique state of the form $(\ell,\lambda,r,r)$; different $\lambda$ give disjoint classes; and every $t$-cup in $L$ with endpoints $(\ell,\lambda)$ extends uniquely by adjoining $r$.

Dually, specialize to $a=1$. Since
$$
\widetilde Q_+(1,L;\ell,\lambda)=0 \text{ unless } \lambda=\ell,\qquad \widetilde Q_+(1,L;\ell,\ell)=1,
$$
the fixed-state identity becomes
$$
C^\times(1,t,P;\ell,\ell,\rho,r)=Q_-(t,R;\rho,r).
$$
Summing over the remaining endpoint parameter $\rho$ gives the exact spanning-cap identity
$$
Q_-^\times(t+1,P;\ell,r)
=
\sum_{\rho\in R,\ \rho<r} Q_-(t,R;\rho,r).
$$
Again there is no inequality: a spanning $(t+1)$-cap with outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$ has exactly one left-side point, namely $\ell$, hence a unique state of the form $(\ell,\ell,\rho,r)$; different $\rho$ give disjoint classes; and every $t$-cap in $R$ with endpoints $(\rho,r)$ extends uniquely by adjoining $\ell$.

So the corrected one-split framework does not lose endpoint information. The exact state is $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$, and the crossing identities are exact sums over the single remaining endpoint parameter after the degenerate specializations $b=1$ and $a=1$.

In [[bounds/upper-bound-recursive-family]], the first inequality that actually forgets the matched outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$ of a convex subset is
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m).
$$
A convex $k$-subset determines an upper-hull cup and a lower-hull cap with the same outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$, but the right-hand side counts arbitrary pairs of cups and caps of the indicated sizes, whether or not they share those endpoints. That is the genuine endpoint-forgetting step.

This should be distinguished from the earlier auxiliary inequalities
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le 2\,Q_\pm(r,P_{m-1})+2^{m-1}Q_\pm(r-1,P_{m-1})
$$
and
$$
Q_\pm(r,P_m)\le d_r\,2^{rm}.
$$
Those inequalities are used only to bound total cup/cap counts. They are not the step where a convex set is represented by two hull chains and the requirement of matching outer endpoints is discarded.

Restoring endpoint matching alone does not explain, and by itself does not improve, the leading constant $1$ in
$$
f(n)\le 2^{(\log_2 n)^2+O(\log n)}.
$$
The reason is that the coefficient of $(\log_2 n)^2$ comes from the later optimization using the coarse total bounds for $Q_+$ and $Q_-$. Exact endpoint matching may change only lower-order factors associated with summing over endpoint choices; without a substantially sharper endpoint-refined bound than the present total $Q_\pm$ estimates, it does not change the leading quadratic constant.
```

# Your Task

Independently verify the worker's output above. Do not verify formal Lean code - focus on informal reasoning, logical correctness, and whether the task was completed as requested.

======== RESPONSE ========

On the mathematical content, I do not see a substantive gap. The note does what the task asks: it gives a `Summary:`, states the fixed-state and fixed-split identities as exact identities, derives the spanning-cup and spanning-cap formulas from the $b=1$ and $a=1$ specializations, explains why those are exact sums over the one remaining endpoint parameter, identifies
$$
C_k(P_m)\le \sum_{a=2}^k Q_+(a,P_m)\,Q_-(k+2-a,P_m)
$$
as the first step that forgets matched outer endpoints $(\ell,r)$, distinguishes that from earlier auxiliary bounds on total $Q_\pm$, and addresses the leading constant $1$.

The logic is coherent. Once the state $(\ell,\lambda,\rho,r)$ is fixed, the factorization into left cup data and right cap data is exact; summing over states is exact because the state classes are disjoint and exhaustive; and in the degenerate cases $b=1$ and $a=1$, the equalities $\rho=r$ and $\lambda=\ell$ force the crossing identities to become exact sums over $\lambda$ or $\rho$ with no inequality. The diagnosis of information loss is also correct: the real loss is pairing arbitrary cups and caps without enforcing shared endpoints, whereas the earlier inequalities only control aggregate cup/cap counts. The final remark about the exponent is sound as stated: restoring endpoint matching alone does not by itself improve the coefficient of $(\log_2 n)^2$ without stronger endpoint-refined bounds.

VERDICT: CORRECT
