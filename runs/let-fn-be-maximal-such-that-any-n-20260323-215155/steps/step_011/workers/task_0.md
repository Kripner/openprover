Focus only on the upper-bound direction.

Context:
- We already have the lower bound stored as [[bounds/lower-bound-averaging]].
- A literature search pointed to Goaoc–Hubard–de Joannis de Verclos–Sereni–Volec, *Limits of Order Types* (SoCG 2015), as giving an explicit recursive family $P_m$ of size $2^m$:
  $P_{m+1}=P_m^0\cup P_m^1$, with $P_m^1$ to the right of $P_m^0$, every point of $P_m^1$ above every line through two points of $P_m^0$, and every point of $P_m^0$ below every line through two points of $P_m^1$.
- The search also reported a recurrence for the number $Q_+(r,P_m)$ of $r$-cups:
$$
Q_+(r,P_{m+1})\le 2Q_+(r,P_m)+2^m Q_+(r-1,P_m),
$$
and similarly for caps.

Task:
Starting from this recursive construction and the reported cup/cap recurrence, determine rigorously what upper bound on the total number of convex subsets follows.

Please do exactly this:
1. Derive a finite-level upper bound for $C_k(P_m)$, the number of $k$-point subsets of $P_m$ in convex position.
2. Check carefully the conversion from cup/cap counts to convex-$k$ counts. If the right statement is “every convex $k$-tuple contains a $\lceil k/2\rceil$-cup or cap” (or a nearby variant), make that precise and quantify any loss.
3. Sum over $k$ to obtain an upper bound for
$$
g(P_m):=\#\{A\subseteq P_m: A\text{ is in convex position}\}.
$$
Express the result in terms of $m$ and then $n=2^m$.
4. State the best leading constant $\alpha$ in a bound of the form
$$
g(P_m)\le 2^{(\alpha+o(1))(\log_2 n)^2}
$$
that your derivation actually proves.
5. If the literature-search conversion overclaimed something, do not patch it heuristically; instead identify the exact obstruction and give the strongest rigorous bound you can still prove from the same input.

Deliverable:
- A proof-quality writeup suitable to store as a repo item if correct.
- If there is an obstruction, give a clean writeup of the obstruction plus the corrected bound.
- Do not discuss lower bounds or general literature history beyond what is needed for this derivation.
